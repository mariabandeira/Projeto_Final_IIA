Dave;Awesome vacuum, offensive customer support;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;September 8, 2023;United States;"
The vacuum does a great job when it is working.  After 3 weeks I started receiving errors after every time I used it.  Their customer support sucks.  After attempting to troubleshoot it they told me to send it back.  They essentially told me to film myself giving the return package to the delivery person and if it gets lost in the mail then they will attempt to help me.Instead of jumping through all their hoops and gambling on shipping the product back and hoping nothing happens to the package along the way I decided to work with Amazon for a replacement which was a much more comforting experience.  The other reviews about the extended turnaround/repair time also scared me into not wanting to deal with their support any longer than I had to.Here is the Roborock's customer support message containing the return instructions.  Judge it for yourself:""Hi there,Thanks for your reply.Attached file is UPS prepaid label you could print out to ship the device to us.The shipping label doesn't include a box. Please ship out the device with original package if you still have it. If not, you can find a suitable size box and put some bubble wrap or waste newspapers inside to protect the robot. If the robot is damaged during shipping, we are afraid we won't be responsible for it.Remember to tell us after you ship it out, otherwise we won't know it's delivered.The label is valid for 7 days. You need to use it before it's expired. If the label is expired, we are afraid we couldn't provide you a new label anymore and you need cover the fee to ship the device to our repair center.If you ship back the device by yourself after the label gets expired, you need to update the carrier and tracking number to us once you've shipped it out.Note:1. The repair center won't accept any package whose tracking info isn't told us in advance.2. Remember to ship the device with all accessories (including charging dock). If the vacuum tank is removable, empty it before shipping. Also, if you have a clean tank and a dirty tank on the dock, please empty them as well.3.

You will need to cover the shipping fee and ship back the correct device by yourself.5. We will send you a replacement after our warehouse confirms they receive the correct item.Warm Tips:We have received a lot of empty packages lately and we are unable to proceed with the refund, replacement or repair service. To avoid any loss on you, we suggest you do the following three things when shipping out the device:1. Keep the carrier's receipt.2.

ryan flournoy;Actually Not That Great;Color: White;Verified Purchase;March 11, 2024;United States;"
My dogs rarely make a mistake inside but this does not recognize pet messes and it will spread poop. The mop portion isn't good at all. My floors are hand scraped wood so it's wavy and the mop cannot get in the very shallow valleys so I have to clean the dog paw prints myself. The vacuum portion isn't great at all. I frequently have to go over areas with a stick vac that performs far superior. It gets stuck on cords, shoe laces, corners of rugs, socks, t-shirts, in actual corners with no obstruction, kitchen tables, chairs, etc. I've had to move it away from a corner because it thought there was a cliff or it was out of bounds.For the price I would not purchase this again. You set it to run while your out and 5 minutes in it's stopped because it thinks your living room suddenly developed a cliff or a sock that the dog pulled out clogged the rollers. Then it needs to charge again because just sitting there giving an occasional notification is enough to burn the battery down. Which brings me to my final point, it cannot clean the 1400 Sq. Ft. area without running out of battery. So it docks, charges, then kicks off again several hours later once it's charged. Why bother with a schedule if it's gonna clean throughout the day because the battery is weak?

Moreover had to reconnect over 70 devices (laptops / phones / tv / speakers/  security system / smart switches , plugs / smart devices ) .. pretty much every single thing connected to wifi because this fancy $1600 worth of floor cleaning robot won‚Äôt work unless I change the password . Moreover here‚Äôs the official troubleshooting instructions that were sent by manufacturers Helpdesk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èsome of which advise changing routers DNS/encryption/IP address . This is a bit too much to get a vaccum/mop to work -Our devices don't support 5GHZ wifi. If your set-up steps are correct but it's still not connecting, try methods below:1. Please go to google play or app store to check if your Roborock app is latest. If not, please upgrade it to latest one and try to connect wifi again.2. Make sure the password of your wifi you've input is correct.3. Don't use an android tablet, iPad, iPhone 5 or iPhone 5C to connect the robot as there might be a compatibility issue.4.

Pay more attention to the select wifi step. See attached picture ""select your home wifi"".7. If there are special characters like !@#$ in your wifi name or password, it's suggested to remove them in the router settings.8. The robot doesn't support WEP encryption mode. If your wifi is WEP, change it to WPA or WPA2.9. If you understand the router's setting very well, try to change DNS to 8.8.8.8 in the router's settings page.10. Reboot your device and router and try again.11. If your phone's cellular network or VPN is enabled, please disable them and try again.12. Check if your router's IP address is 192.168.8.1.

Charles H.;WHEN WORKING - ITS AMAZING, HOWEVER BAD FOR PET TOY OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE.;Color: White;Verified Purchase;December 28, 2023;United States;"
This product works super well, ONLY when all goes well. More floors have never been cleaner. HOWEVER, THERE IS A MASSIVE DESIGN FLAW! Unfortunately, this product has HORRIFYINGLY TERRIBLE obstacle avoidance for small objects, cords, & strings. I wish it had a feature to perhaps reverse the rotation of its suction brushes to unjam itself. I have a cat who likes to take out her toys and puts them all over the floor when I am not home. She's a kitten, so she wants to play and it would be wrong to curb this behavior. Because of the Roborock absolutely terrible obstacle avoidance, even if they claim it is so much improved, it is horrifyingly bad for such an expensive vacuum. Everytime my cat takes her string toy out (which is a daily occurance) it will end up jammed in the feeder. It is now at the point, that I must be home to monitor it - at which point I might as well just vacuum and mop myself. I like for it to clean when I am not home, so I don't need to hear the loud noise. But, now it is at a point where everytime I leave I have to make sure everything is off the floor or it will jam up and I'm scared will eventually break the product. They really need features to fix this as most homes will have something like this eventually. Also, the rotating bristles that draw in the dirt, bend within a very short amount of time of using it. I read about this in many reviews& recommended to buy a separate bristle online that works better, but now I totally see it first hand. That being said - all around, its a great product, I just wish the obstacle avoidance was a lot better.

Scott196941;Cool features - not as smart as it should be for the $$;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;January 6, 2024;United States;"
It has great features like cliff sensor and smart object avoidance which it does well.  I like the robot in general and it‚Äôs my first experience with one.  The problem is the path it takes makes absolutely no sense and is not efficient.  I set it to vacuum first, then mop.  It goes through the vacuum cycle (unfortunately, it goes over and over areas where it makes no sense and it acts confused).  Then when it goes to mop the hardwood, it will randomly go back to sweeping carpet that it has already swept in rooms 2 rooms away from the mopping rooms (it does this multiple times and makes no sense).  I have high pile light colored carpet and I don‚Äôt want the wetness from the mop on the carpet. So this feature doesn‚Äôt work properly.  Because it goes back to sweeping carpet and goes over the same path multiple times (I counted that it went over the same path 6 times on multiple occasions like it‚Äôs confused) when it should be mopping, I found myself stopping the entire cycle and simply using the clean a specific room feature.  The biggest reason I stopped this unnecessary sweeping was because the battery life is poor.  I get 1hr 20 mins before  it has to recharge.  I have 1,500 sq ft on the first floor so it has to charge 4 times and it takes at least an hour to recharge.  I started the cycle at 9:30am and it didn‚Äôt finish until 6:30pm.  This is why I gave this robot 3 stars.  For $1,500+, this robot should be smarter and more efficient than it is.  I don‚Äôt feel like I can start it when I go to work and have the house be done by the time I get home.  Instead, I have to manage it.  I could‚Äôve paid for a $800 robot for that hassle.

Purchased Oct 2023. Within 3 months of usage the Ultra 8 started malfunctioning.1. Rust ( look at the pics. Your mop pads will bleed rust from the machine to the mopping pads)2. Yes, contacted customer services, they wouldn‚Äôt replace the item but they will ‚Äúrepair‚Äù it under the ‚Äúwarranty‚Äù. Found my own box, secured the packaging to prevent shilling damages, utilized their UPS label to their repair shop.3. 4 weeks since submitting the initial claim and receiving the ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù vacuum. Take a look at the video I uploaded to determine if you think that‚Äôs mopping the floor‚Ä¶ the mop is no longer making contact with the floor.Update March 2024:Vacuum was sent for repair, this took total of 3 weeks to receive the ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù vacuum. The rusted parts were replaced but the mop feature wouldn‚Äôt mop. Just made drops of water along the way. Emailed them again and they instructed me to mail it back to them so that they can send me a refurbished vacuum. This took another 3-4 weeks (that‚Äôs including emailing back and forth, shipping it back to them and receiving the refurbished item. The result is: it works but the machine is much louder when vacuuming. And the mop works 70% of the time. This is frustrating. Great vacuum when it‚Äôs brand new until you run into issues. This machine was not made to last. Sorry- I do not recommend. And their warranty process is very frustrating and time consuming.

I was very excited to try out this vacuum after extensive research, and it was clear that this is the best of the best out there.I wanted so badly for this to be our Unicorn Vacuum that solved the following:1. Vacuumed thoroughly , including wall edge2. Washed tough stuck on messes3. Avoids obstacles by moving around them without getting StuckHowever, this was our reality1. Vacuum suction did not meet expectations as crumbs ( big and small) would be left behind in random areas2. Washed superficially but didn‚Äôt get messes that were mildly stuck on ( post baby throwing food on the floor)3. Struggled with obstacles such as toys and shoes, it would skip the area entirely ( I hoped it would atleast vaccum around the object )Ofcourse these issues could be solved by not having sticky messes on the floor that need to be mopped and having absolutely minimal obstacles in its way, however with kids this seemed unrealistic which for us defeats it‚Äôs purpose.I would recommend this product for someone with no pets/ kids that just needs a regular upkeep of standard messes.But the value of the vacuum  didn‚Äôt seem to be justified

Comparisson to roomba i7. I switched my roomba for this model and put it in the same previous location as my roomba.Compared to roomba this has a harder time finding home and charging itself. It frequently misaligns and sits on the station without charging until its battery dies. 1-2x a week I have to manually realign it to get it to charge. Compared to roomba it also gets stuck more often under chairs, etc.The mop feature is great and the clean is better on the hardwood floors section.Design flaws with the water tank. The lid is designed so it doesnt stay open on its own. You cant set it in the sink to refill it, you have to manually hold it open the entire time - see video.Overall it is a good concept of a product, but the programming doesnt seem as good as roomba has several annoying design flaws.

Mark A. Crothers;Great robot...  pathetic cleaner.;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;April 7, 2024;United States;"
I used to have a Roomba S9. It got lost and stuck all the time and I tired of searching for it.  This robot does a wonderful job of obstacle avoidance and mapping. You can always find the machine live in the app, you can easily tell where it has cleaned and what path it is on.  When things go wrong,  there is nothing ambiguous about what you have to do to fix it.  Any clogs or tangles are easily cleared. The rollers and filters are robust and last a very long time.  It realizes the difference between hard floors and rugs.  Changing water and bags is a breeze.However...  and this is a BIG However...This thing can barely clean at all.Basically it sweeps some of pet hair into balls that I have to pick up, the rest stays where it lies.  I have mine set to multiple passes at maximum cleaning, but I have to use my regular vacuum often in order to get the majority.One of the weirdest choices Roborock made was to have the cleaning base suck dirt out if the robot's bin back through the rollers and out the same path it came in. This does not work well. The result is that the bin often remains full, and there is no way to know that the robot is now just traveling around making noise because it is still full.It nicely wipes the floors, but I would not call it a mopping.  Just a wipe.  It will keep hard floors from being dusty, but will not for example remove a pawprint from a dog that came in from wet grass.All in all I'm dissapointed.  It is by far the most expensive cleaning robot I have ever purchased, and I have owned 4 of them...It is certainly not worth it.

I‚Äôve owned this a while now and the experience has been disappointing.- front wheel spontaneously shattered while in use. It then ran over the shards and jammed itself. It was easy to buy replacement wheels at least‚Ä¶- Later, the door holding the rollers in spontaneously broke while vacuuming, and the rollers fell out. It kept trying to operate, ineffectually.- It leaves large amounts of dust and debris at the edges of area rugs, because when it climbs onto  the rug, it‚Äôs tilted and lifted too high to get adequate suction to vacuum the floor next to the rug.- Its object avoidance doesn‚Äôt detect cables and cords, which it often gets jammed on. I need to carefully check that a few are up and out of the way before each run.- Gets stuck on floor vent covers.- Sometimes gets stuck on the legs of chairs after successfully navigating inside the chair ‚Äî why can‚Äôt it retrace its route to get back out?All in all, I find myself still needing to redo its job after it runs. It‚Äôs better than nothing, but not good enough.

This thing has a very impressive vacuum but to say it ""mops"" is quite a stretch. All it does is drag the pad around. Unless you start with an already pretty clean floor, this thing is hardly going to do much in the way of cleaning. I made note of dozens of spots on the floor for a before and after comparison and literally ALL of them remained relatively untouched after a mop.If you're getting this to maintain a floor that you plan on cleaning with something actually capable like a shark steam mop then that's one thing. If you think this thing is going to keep up on your mopping for you, your are hella mistaken.

This is written with the understanding that no robot vac is going to replace using a standard vacuum and floor cleaning.  You will always have to do a more thorough cleaning weekly.I purchased this in May for a brand new house.  We have mostly LVP floors with a few densely woven thick pile rugs.  We don't wear shoes in the house. We have two large dogs that shed a lot, they are in the house a couple hours a day and lay on the living room rug. I do brush them at least every other day...yet the shedding continues!  I was hoping this would save me a bit of sanity.I was not able to use this until August, so I am past the return date.  Had I known it would not be able to keep up with the dog hair on the carpet, I would have went with a lower price machine and just have it take care of the hard floors because even with this pricey top of the line model, I may as well just have it do the hard floors and vacuum the rugs myself. I throughly vacuumed everything twice before beginning to run the roborock through its paces.  I have been using it nightly for a week, increasing suction and trying to figure out a way to get it to get the hair off my carpets.  It is not working.Watch the video and you will see that after having the vacuum suction on max, and setting it to deep clean there is still hair on top of the rug that come off with the pass of a roller (or my socks, or on my pants, etc.  (During deep clean it goes over the carpet twice, which BTW my nice upright vacuum requires two passes during heavy shedding season) the pictures show how much dirt and hair I vacuumed off of a 14 by 20 foot area after the roborock had just gone over my carpet, twice on max.  (And my dogs had not set foot on it yet)This really does not hold true to what it says it will do, but in the end, it does help keep at least some of the hair in the house under control that is on the hard surfaces, I appreicate the self cleaning and dust sumping feature and it is very good at mapping. But for the price, if you have dogs or lots of other dirt, I would get a lower priced machine.

Had it for several months now, but to be honest owning Roborock MaxV Pro Ultimate this is kind of two steps forward, one step back kind of deal. It has good pathing. It cleans adequately well (not much better than S7 latest model) and most of all lacking video camera. A lot of people do not like it due to privacy issues, but it is huge help.l, especially when you are let's say at the dentist being treated and get the message that roborock is stuck. With live feed camera you can reorient (with lag delay) and remotely control roborock out of whatever it stuck on, but without camera on S8 you have to rely on house map, and blind orientation in hopes you can guess good enough at your robots direction, or click point and go enough for it to finally get unstuck. There is better suction and better, somewhat better scrubbing (still not good enough, just enough to clean up, before you need to hard scrub hardcore stains and glued toddler food to the floor yourself, but enough to help you where you don't have to do the backbreaking labor of cleaning entire floor yourself), but not to the point of wow factor.

This creation is unbelievable!  I used roomba's only, and after the last one self-cleaning completely dissatisfied me I decided to try something new. Then I think of all robotic activities this thing can do, sometimes it makes my head to spin around. Performance is great, the setting options for cleaning and etc via phone app is unbelievable. All you have to do is discard the dirty water tank, refill the clean water tank and occasionally change the vacuum bag. The design, the materials the product is made off speaks volumes too. This floor robot is worth every single penny of it. Might be not easy get it connected to the app, though. For some unknown reason I wasn't able to connect it with my galaxy 5 flip, but was fine with my old galaxy flip phone. Super happy with my investment.I don't know what went wrong, if it is the latest software update or what, but performance is terrible now. This thing even can't pickup a light small pieces from the floor, keeps a lot of places not vacummed, same goes for mopping. The stars I gave are only for the idea, no need to clean it and for a lot of cleaning setting options other than that no good at all.Amazon won't let me add up more than 1 picture,(had to submit the review, go back and upload it,don't feel like spending a half of hour on sharing my review)kept saying something went wrong. My opinion something really went wrong with Amazon because it is nothing like it used to be.At this point to save my nerves I pulled out my 11 years old roomba to finally get my floors cleaned.

My Roborock is less than a year old. Yet a couple of months ago, it stopped going back to charge when the battery gets low and just sits there. I have contacted customer service both directly and through Amazon. After making me send videos, exchanging information, which took some significant time, their only offered solution was to send the robot to the repair facility, which would mean that I would be without the robot for about three weeks, taking into account shipping back and forth. I didn't pay $1,600 for a device to have to be without it and spending hours doing my floors myself. I requested both time that they send a new unit (and I would gladly return the defective one after I get the replacement), to no avail. What a disappointment. So be prepared for your unit to stop working well after about 6 months and figure if $1,600 is worth it for you.

I have been happy with most features on this product, the app is nice, I can check the status of the robot, pause it, change it‚Äôs current routine and so on.I like the dock, auto empty and how easy it is to empty and refill to containers for the clean and dirty water.The mapping did well, and adjusts to new obstacles just fine, like the cat sitting in its way, watching it.  The robot went around.  There was no robot vs cat showdown.What I have not been happy with is that is seems this robot is built for flat surfaces.  I have tried it simply for vacuuming purposes on a tile floor and it, on differing suction settings, doesn‚Äôt always get between the tiles cleaned well, not to mention how horribly it mops a tile floor.  It skips the edges of the tile and the grout (see photo).It is great for keeping daily dust and cat hair off the floor but there is a cost to benefit ratio to consider.

I bought the device because of its LIDAR navigation and top of the line coswt. I read the manuals and learned the diagrams of all parts and their maintenance intervals. The roborock app did not recognize my wireless network but the MiHome app did and mapped my rooms. I elevated all the chairs in the house during the mapping then I vacuumed all the carpeted areas and mopped the wood floors with the device. The dust bin in the device was absolutely clean, containing no dust. The filter in the dust bin was clean and looked new. The dust bag in the large plastic container in the mothership was empty after emptying the robot bin using the app. The dirty water container contained essentially clean water after emptying the robot. The wood floors were still dirty. I called roborock tech support. The were utterly incompetent and obstructionist. They first sent me a text message ""to confirm I could receive text messages."" I asked why they couldn't send a troubleshooting text message as their first message? They said this is their protocol. Then they sent me a troubleshooting text. In it they asked me to crumble crumbs on the floor and take a video of the robot passing over the crumbs and send it to them. I said why couldn't they just walk me through troubleshooting steps. They hung-up on me. I called back and got a different representative. I asked them to walk me through troubleshooting steps. They said they couldn't help me and had to transfer me back to the first representative because that is their protocol. I objected. They wouldn't budge. I returned the device. It didn't work at all. I wasted a whole day. Very frustrating. Bad support and non-functioning device.

Embarking on my journey with the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra Robot, the initial weeks were nothing short of delightful. The device presented itself as a capable, intelligent, and convenient cleaning companion, offering a welcome respite from manual house cleaning. Its sleek design, efficient mapping, and strategic cleaning paths particularly stood out, creating an illusion of a hands-free cleaning future.However, as weeks progressed, the sheen rapidly diminished, giving way to a plethora of frustrating issues that overshadowed its once admired capabilities. The consistent stumbling block was the frequent entrapments ‚Äì the robot often found itself lodged in corners or stuck amidst household items, requiring constant supervision and defeating the purpose of an autonomous cleaner.The pet hair management, or the lack thereof, was another stumbling block for my experience. The tangles, jams, and subsequent manual cleanups became a frequent ritual, with the robot struggling to manage the hair shed from my furry companions. The minuscule dust bin and impractically designed dust bag compartment further exacerbated the problem, creating more mess than it managed to clean up.This accumulation of issues eventually dulled the initial sparkle of technological convenience. After a few short weeks, I found myself pondering whether manually cleaning my home was indeed a more reliable and less frustrating alternative to the now erratic robot vacuums.When the Roborock finally capitulated just three months into its tenure, the disillusionment was further amplified by the staggeringly slow and inconvenient customer service, providing responses often after a full 24-hour cycle and in the unsociable hours of 2 - 4 am.In reflection, while the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra Robot initially dazzles with its intelligent navigation and sleek design, the subsequent myriad of operational and design flaws quickly dim its appeal. My journey from initial delight to subsequent frustration has reshaped my perspective, positioning a manual cleaning session as a more appealing prospect than wrestling with the recurring issues presented by the robot.

Anton;Gets tangled in cords;Color: White;Verified Purchase;October 14, 2023;United States;"
The idea of the vacuum cleaner and mop is great. However, this model lacks the camera, which allowed the previous model to effectively detect and avoid cords and cables on the floor. This model has the advantage of drying the mop, preventing it from stinking however, the fact that it cannot avoid simple cords makes me want to look for an alternative model with a camera, which can more effectively detect and avoid such obstacles.

This thing was wonderful for the six months or so that it worked. After that, we started having tons of problems with the vacuum action... Originally saying that it was clogged though we couldn't find anything in the base or the vacuum. Eventually it stopped saying it was clogged but now it doesn't pick anything up at all.. extremely disappointed for the cost.

Arun Gupta;Extremely poor object avoidance;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;November 24, 2023;United States;"
The object avoidance is extremely poor. It gets tangled in every cord and charger. It cannot avoid any object that is smaller than a pair of flip flops. Knocked/displaced everything else. Got seriously tangled in every charging cord.Very noisy: The mop drying takes a default time of 3 hours. For 3 hours, the vacuum keeps making a whirring noise as it dries the mop. The duration of drying cannot be set to less than 2 hours. So, for two hours, the vacuum will keep making a whirring noise as it dries the mop.Strange behavior: If the power to the main unit is cut, the robot jumps off the charging dock and just stands in front of the dock, away from it. Why can't it stay on the dock? No idea. Imagine if the power goes off and the robot is now standing in front of the dock. Anyone can stumble on it in the dark and have an accident.Map loading: Map loading is slow, slow , slow. It just kept complaining about slow network. It is actually not the network, it is something to do with the roborock itself. At one time, I had to power cycle the main unit to get the map to load.Mapping: The map editing is very clumsy. I tried to keep rotating the 3D map to an orientation which made sense to me, but as I rotated clockwise, it kept moving the map anti-clockwise. Had a tough time getting the map oriented to the way I wanted.For the price, I expected lot better.

Ben W;Roborock's having some QC and support issues;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;January 31, 2024;United States;"
I have 2 roborock S6 MaxVs, and in November 2023 I bought the S8 Pro Ultra, and then again in mid-December for my mother for Christmas. I am a HUGE fan of these devices. I tell so many people about them. I've never had a problem with them that wasn't easily corrected.Of course when I gifted my mom one of these for Christmas, problems started. First the water tank stopped self-emptying. Mom contacted support, and of course they recommend ""factory reset"". This, for whatever reason, made it so water would self empty, strange, but ok whatever. Then a few days later, the vacuum portion stopped self-emptying. Support for Roborock got quiet when we inquired about a warranty exchange, twice.Now that today is the last day for returns, I wanted to exchange the item, however that wasn't an option and now it is $400 more than what I paid in mid-December. I contacted Amazon, who wanted me to return the original, pay full price for another, and offered to only comp the difference after the item was delivered. This sounds suspicious, I asked why I couldn't get comped after I placed the order, and was given ""we just can't"". So no, I will not be paying another $1600 and hope that Amazon will give me a partial reimbursement. This has been a failure all around with both Amazon and Roborock.

Edward Romanita;Really tough to connect app to device;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;December 22, 2023;United States;"
This vacuum relies solely on the app on your phone to map Out the house and properly clean.  Without connecting to the app on your phone it just cleans a small area over and over instead of the entire house.  I was able to connect the app initially and it worked great for a week.  After that it disconnected and have not been able to reconnect t agin.  It was so frustrating that I ended up returning the unit and just got another one.  Guess what?  Still not able to connect!

Brian B;Horrible customer service;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;May 24, 2023;United States;"
If you buy this and have a problem don‚Äôt count on them giving you any kind of reasonable customer support. They always have an excuse or they always come back asking for more information even after you have provided them step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem 100% of the time. This company Hass to have the worst customer service on the planet, making Comcast look like a dream to deal with. For what this costs there‚Äôs no excuse for their condescending attitude and behavior. I recommend you look for a different vendor‚Äôs product.The sad thing is, when it works it works great, but they have serious algorithm problems where the device cannot get around certain obstacles if it is said to clean specific rooms, but if it is said to do a full house cleaning it can get around those same obstacles that have not moved 1 mm from the last cleaning. I‚Äôve reported this to them, I‚Äôve provided them high resolution video, screenshots, logs, multiple phone calls, and multiple emails. They keep coming back with more and more excuses. This is not a company you want to do business with until they change their behavior and attitude.One more thing, don‚Äôt buy this for Alexa integration, because all you can do is start and stop it but you can‚Äôt tell it to do any routines or a specific room or change from mop to vacuum or to both, it‚Äôs basically on or off.I‚Äôd give this zero stars if I were allowed solely because of their customer service.

Brent Mason;Disappointed with Missing Basic Features on the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;February 9, 2024;United States;"
I have been an iRobot customer for years, I decided to make the switch due to reviews online on this product and its ability to mop. While its cleaning performance and navigation capabilities are great, I am left disappointed by the absence of basic features that should be standard in a vacuum of this caliber.One such feature missing is auto-detection when the dustbin is full. It's baffling that a device at this price point lacks such a fundamental functionality instead of being able to rely on the vacuum to alert me when it needs emptying or return to the base to auto-empty. I am forced to constantly monitor it myself, which defeats the purpose of having a fully autonomous cleaning device in the first place. Even budget vacuums costing a fraction of the price come equipped with this feature, making the absence of it on the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra all the more glaring.While the vacuum performs admirably regarding suction power and navigation, its lack of basic functionality severely hampers its overall appeal. Until Roborock addresses this issue, I cannot in good conscience recommend the S8 Pro Ultra to others, especially when more affordable options on the market offer superior convenience.

Pros: When it is operational, it is functioning good. The best way I used this is to separate vacuuming and mopping. That worked best for me.Cons: Fragile parts - After a couple of months of using this, the side brush gearbox and recharge sensor assembly went bad. I did not expect this from a device this expensive to go bad that quicklyCustomer Service - After communicating this with the customer support, they decided to try and fix it. They promised a WEEK but got the device back after a month and half after claiming that the parts are not in stock with no definite timeline when it will arrive. I asked if we can just replace it and miraculously they found the parts they are looking for. They sent the device back worse than ever. It looked like they tested it in a coal mine and then sent it back to us (see pictures). Save yourself some money and find something else and also one of the worst customer support I received

Unit scuffs walls and frequently rams into doors. But above all, the customer support is absolutely garbage and they cut and paste from a script over and over.

We originally swapped from the Roomba S7 to the Roborock and were orginally super excited. Unfortunately that excitement died quickly as we returned it 3 days later.The Auto-empty bin only empties at the end of jobs, once filled IT WILL NOT empty itself like Roombas do. Instead it just pushed dirt, debris, pet bedding and hair all over the place. The mopping feature was a let down as well. 70% of our home is white tile, it left terrible streaks all throughout and once I used the cross wave on the floor, the water was still black. For $1600 I expected way more functionality. Glad I was able to return it before Cyber Monday ended so I can buy and tryout the IRobot J9+ Combo.If you decide to read this and ignore, I will say the White does look super slick in person.

This is my 3rd Roborock and until recently I was a very happy customer. After 6-months, the $1,600 robot stopped mopping. The mop is bone dry every time, the base gives no error, but it never pumps water into the robot and never makes the mop wet. See the attached video. I've tried everything that customer support recommended (check the seals, the vent, the hose inside the clean water tank) and its still not working.I expect such an expensive robot to work better than this. It has obvious design flaws including that the hose inside the water tank is held in place by nothing more than friction. Over time it will come loose and you have to pry the clean water tank open to put the hose back on, which is ridiculous. They should have designed it with a locking mechanism to make sure mechanical movement doesn't jar it loose.I would not buy this robot until they ensure mopping is reliable.

Because this is a newer piece of equipment, there is almost no online information or resources when this thing isn't working right. We have had the dreaded error 42 whenever trying to wash the mop head, a key part of the mopping process as the mop head is typically washed multiple times during mopping. Following all the recommendations to fix it does not fix it, and this seems to be the experience for most of the people who get this error. So now we have to be massively inconvenienced and return this large and heavy box and hope if we try again that we don't get a defective product. Overall, you are paying for the tech and premise, because the machine itself and it's hub are very cheap feeling plastic and not fully fleshed out.

Vaccuum cannot find the dock station 90% of the time.  Even when it's right in front of the vaccuum, it starts to move towards it but somehow it cannot find it accurately and starts to drive away from it little by little until it errors out indicating it couldn't find the dock.  The dustbin always gives an error about not being able to empty it, not a single time since I bought it, so the duct is not clogged or anything, and it makes a lot of noise so I know its not that the dock is not able to suck the dust but its simply not emptying the dust bin.  I had an Roborock S5 that is still working, I have it cleaning the garage now, that one is better than this one for sure, way less features but at least it worked.  Without the dustbin cleaning, its like not having that feature.  And I have to place it on the dock myself, the old one does it on its own.

We received the product and it does not work and when trying to return the only option was to stay home and wait days for UPS driver who showed up once a week later when we were not home. We could not just take to Amazon drop off or UPS store. They want to make returns as hard as possible.

I had to return this because, despite following all instructions to connect the device to my 2.4 GhZ network, it was failing to connect. I suggest you try the connection before you set up everything. What a shame!

Jen;Not worth the money;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;January 9, 2024;United States;"
This robot vacuum is extremely temperamental. It constantly pauses cleaning, dies during a cleaning or gets stuck despite having mapped the rooms. My ancient roomba is far less problematic. It doesn‚Äôt seem to mop consistently and misses quite a bit of dirt. I have already changed the mop pad out and maintain the machine but it is so difficult my eldest daughter told me I need to file it as a dependent on my taxes.

Read the very end of the product description, where it says it doesn‚Äôt work with 5G networks. This means if you have T-Mobile, it will not work on your phone. How one can create such an advanced product that nobody can use who owns advanced products is beyond me‚Ä¶.

I purchased this robot upon black Friday discounts and it just malfunctioned within ONE hour after I unboxed it. When I was setting the house map, the robot could not return to dock. The robot went forwards and backwards towards the sensor, trying to calibrate its position but it always failed. I tried to reset and restore the machine, but they didn‚Äôt help at all. So I returned the machine immediately.

I'd strongly suggest avoiding Roborock unless you want a $1600 paperweight. My unit worked for less than a week before getting stuck in a state where it couldn't turn on, charge, or even factory reset. Roborock support has been utterly worthless as well - they made absolutely no attempts to troubleshoot the issue, demanded I ship it back, and now I'm stuck waiting multiple weeks for a replacement that I shouldn't have had to deal with in the first place. Pathetic quality control.

This is a very expensive device sweeps and mops.However, mopping is not a very good mopping feature.  Do not recommend. Supposedly empty its self. Not very good quality at all for the cost.I do not recommend this item at this cost.

This is my second roborock I have. The S7 went out of order within 3 months. I was able to return with a restock fee $200 sth while it was a prime item. The S8 went out of order in 3 months again. I tried everything they said and it still has the fan error. Sometime it has cliff sensor error. The robot keep spinning around and won‚Äôt move forward. I won‚Äôt try their products anymore. Their robots are so expensive.

I ve bought this exiting product. It was all good until the robot returned to the base after his first charge. He was unable to charge and was leaving the dock 5 min after connecting to it. The support asked me to make some procedures that did not helped. I am returning the product. Very frustrating for a !$1.5K product

No where on the product page does it say it will NOT work with 5G networks.  I did t find that out until I received it.  It may work great but if I can‚Äôt use the app and all the options the app affords, I can buy a cheaper one.  I was really excited to get this and disappointed that I can‚Äôt use it.  Boxing it up to send back now.

I was super excited to use the product but unfortunately the item was damaged. The dock had big scratches and this seemed to be not caused by shipping but rather manufacturing defect. Poor quality control. I was able to request for a refund but it takes couple of weeks to get the refund. There was no option for an exchange.
