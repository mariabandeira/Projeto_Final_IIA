Justice;needs two people to assemble;April 29, 2023;United States;"this was NOT easy to assemble. directions were bad so I watch a video. figured out i needed another person. can't find any instructions on why the back support moves. idk if this supposed to happen. I am 5'2"" and this fits me perfectly at the lowest setting. I suffered a back injury and this chair is helping. the seat is very comfortable.";4
Wei;updated (poor quality and custom service);November 29, 2023;United States;good thing is it is covered by life time warranty. so just find their website, and email them. they will send the replacement free of charge. ----- updated Dec 2023. casters keep breaking off, and if you will find a lot of similar complaints online. definitely very poor quality. warranty claim is painful, and took months back and forth emails and still can't get the correct parts.;1

A reviewer;Built like a tank, truly ergonomic and with many adjustments;August 18, 2023;United States;I like a firm seat and back, and a chair that will sit you up straight and still be comfortable.;5
Shoe Diva;Best work chair I've ever had;August 8, 2022;United States;My only complaint is that the armrests can't be pushed in towards me. They can angle a bit, but it's not the same as being able to move them in a bit. Overall though, it's my favorite work chair. I only wish it were more affordable so I could buy one for my home office.;5
