They are *Cuisinart* branded, so I expected something a little (a lot) better made. I've only used the big and medium strainers lightly, hand washed and the silver plating is coming off on the handle. But they were inexpensive and do the job of straining stuff.

After two plus years the spot welds were no longer viable on the larger 8” strainer. Since it is the one I use the most, its structural deficiency was most annoying. I’m going with a different strainer that has rivets holding the handle to the strainer head.The other two, smaller strainers have not been a problem, but I fear that in time they will be.

EAJoseph Design;Strainer Hangs from Handle - Brand New;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;January 3, 2024;United States;"
I received these strainers a couple days ago. They're beautiful and because they're Cuisinart, I thought I'd have them for years to come. The only thing I've strained with the large piece is a cup of flour for baking. Apparently, 120g of all-purpose flour is too much for the large strainer to handle because the tack welds (I'm sure it's soldered and not welded, though) broke loose. The head hasn't yet detached from the handle but I could easily break it loose by setting it down in the wrong position.I'm pretty disappointed in my purchase. I bought these instead of an off-brand because of Cuisinart's great reputation.Also, why can't I just contact the seller via Amazon!? I don't want to use the website. I bought the junk here on Amazon and get annoyed when sellers throw you around to 20 different places (probably because they figure you'll rage quit, give up, and just keep whatever useless item(s) you purchased). Now I'm here wasting my time writing a crappy review when I'd rather just be able to use my simple strainers. How difficult is it to tack-solder, Cuisinart? Really?

Worked well for a few months.  Then the spot weld on one side of the handle broke off -- rendering this strainer useless.The spot weld is so tiny and additionally a weak weld.  Made in China.On the other hand, I love my Cuisinart 11 cup food processor.But this strainer is not worthy to bear the Cuisinart brand name.  Such a disappointment.I may try to use one of the epoxy metal super glues to repair the handle.

Johanna;Came flattened;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;March 17, 2023;United States;"
The strainers arrived flattened and out-of-shape, which was disappointing. I used the back of a wooden spoon to round out the screens, which worked well, and the items held up under the pressure. The handles are nice and long, and help the strainers lay flat on bowls and pots while pouring liquids into another receptacle. As with any strainer, holding them upside down over a stream of hot water and then laying them flat on a dishwasher rack in a normal cycle gets bits of food out, and gets them clean. This type of tight mesh is designed to clarify broths, or for light duty, such as straining 1-2 servings of pasta. These items are not meant to be used to hold a couple of pounds of food from when draining a pot full of rice, boiled chicken and vegetables for soup, or bones for broth.

Recently, my son asked me to get him a Cuisinart 3 bowl set for Christmas and I realized that I bought the strainer set and the stainless steel bowl set in December 2013.  My husband and I use the stainless bowls every day and had no issues even with the lids for 10 years.  However, the handle of the largest strainer fell off years ago and there is a gap in quality between these two products.I am not sure how long the strainers should last without quality issues like what I experienced but not happy with the strainer set considering how long the stainless bowl set lasts with even a single scratch or rust for such a long time.

As they say, you get what you pay for! Inexpensive but cheaply made. I've used these strainers for a couple years and they were ok, but they aren't made to last. The handle of the largest one broke off, first one side, then the other. Also when straining some foods, bits of food gets caught underneath the rim so you have make sure to tap the strainer to get the hidden food out of the rim when cleaning. (Not a good seal between strainer and the rim. See paper tucked under rim in picture where food gets hidden). I'll try to find a more expensive but better made set for next purchase if possible.

Kelly;Bad notch design;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;November 9, 2023;United States;"
The notch design makes it so that you can't trust it to hold itself upright on an item. I should be able to just rest the strainer on a bowl or cambro and pour over anything, but if the item is heavy or if you bump it at all, the strainer is likely to fall right into what you're straining into. The notch should be more like a hook or at least flat and not slanted upward.

These just arrived this afternoon.  I was very disappointed when I opened the box. The medium and large strainers are very shallow.  These were a replacement for my 5 year old cheap plastic strainer that the handle was finally cracking off. It was the same diameter as the large Cuisinart one but would easily hold 4 cups of rice for rinsing.  The new one doesn't look like it would hold more than 2 cups.  Instead of sending it back, I will gift it to a young relative who just starting out on their own and doesn't have much in the way of kitchen tools. I'll just look for another replacement and this time research more on the capacity than of the name and number of positive reviews.

These are trash, plain and simple, period! I know for the price point, you get what you pay for, right? But what (albeit mildly) surprises me is Cuisinart put their name on these, and that's the hook! You see that name and you know (that long ago) this company actually cared about the quality of the product that bore their name. But today's companies are more interested in P&L percentages and who cares weather the actual product is any good. They will squeeze every single penny out of the good name and then squeeze some more. I think it fair to say that as little as 25 years ago, no good company would put out the kind of garbage that is the norm rather than the exception today. Now I'm all for paying a fair price for a fair whatever, and I'm all for a company making a fair profit, even a good profit, that's what makes this country run. But that's all a thing of the past, just like seeing ""Made in the US"". Ok enough, what makes these trash? The actual strainer part is a seriously thin gauge of cheap metal (I think it is some sort of metal), it almost flexes like a stiff fabric. So too are the rest of the parts and the tiny little welds that hold the handles on fall apart with almost no stress at all. I barely use these because they are so bad and I treat them like eggs when I do use them and they have all fallen apart. Of course, I'm way outside my return window (my fault, I should've sent these back immediately but did not). I foolishly thought that because of the name, they should be ok, even though I kind of know better. I just keep thinking that companies with good names will give you good products. Never again! Caveat Emptor from now on and with everything. But as long as these companies continue to get away with these practices, they have no reason to change and in fact it probable encourages them to push it to the absolute limit. Taking pride in your work...RIP.

Won't be buying these again. The handles are flimsy and weak, so straining anything heavier than water bends the handle. For example, straining soup stock, which contains vegetables and meat bones; bent the handle so the strainer was sagging into the bowl. Can't strain something if it's sitting in the liquid you're trying to strain off. Don't feel like I can return them since I've used them, but won't buy from this manufacturer again; will stick to name brand.

The design and construction of these strainers isn't great. While using the large strainer to strain a half cup of white rice, one side of the handle detached from where it was welded to the round lip around the strainer. 2 days later, the other side of the handle detached (again while straining a small amount of rice) and now I have a strainer without a handle. The lip on these, especially the larger one, allow food to slip up inside making them rather difficult to clean. While not exactly expensive, don't expect these strainers to last for long if you do buy a set; mine lasted a year.

Thomas Culliton;Decent strainers, not convenient to store.;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;August 20, 2020;United States;"
These are reasonable enough strainers, if a bit too vulnerable to crushing and deforming, but storing them as a set just isn't what you might hope. Other reviewers have already cover most of the petty annoyances. Since the handles and ears are proportional to the size of the basket, hanging them together by either just doesn't work. That becomes a problem since the mesh of the basket is crushable enough that you really don't want to store them in a drawer.As as indicator of how easy it to deform these, after sifting a couple cups of sugar (~400g) to get rid of humidity induced lumps, the basket of the largest strainer was distinctly lopsided. Just from holding the handle in one hand and tapping the rim against the palm of the other with that much mass in it. This a very common, even conventional, technique for sieving dry ingredients, and really shouldn't produce significant distortions.

I purchased this set of 3 Cuisinart strainers because it had good reviews and I wanted something nicer than the cheap, no-name, falling apart grocery store item I already had.  Unfortunately, I should have stuck with another of those instead of this item.The strainers are attractive, and it appears that the wire mesh is less likely to separate from the rim the way my cheapo strainer did; however, the strainers, particularly the 7-7/8"" strainer are quite flimsy where the handle meets the bowl.  Any attempt to strain anything (and I mean *anything*:  pasta, vegetables, curds) remotely large enough to require the large bowl will result in the strainer hinging where the handle meets the rim and collapsing into the container over which you placed it.As one might imagine, this a) defeats the purpose of having a strainer and b) is extremely irritating.  My recommendation would be that this set makes a lovely decoration, but if you actually want to strain something, look elsewhere.

Grace;Poorly Designed for Handheld Use;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;March 16, 2023;United States;"
These strainers are poorly designed. The handle is not ergonomic. When you hold it, it constantly wants to move from side to side rather than having a firm hold. This is a problem especially for hot food items. Also, the handle is so light that the weight of the strainer pulls it down before you put anything in it. A good strainer should be well balanced and firm in your hand before you start to use it. If you’re going to put it over a bowl then you won’t experience these issues, but for anyone that holds their strainer in their hands this is not a good buy!

Bob Tobias;Not what I expected from the Cuisinart brand;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;May 8, 2021;United States;"
The screens on these strainers is very thin and bends easily. That doesn't affect how they work so much and just makes them feel flimsy.  So far they haven't broken and from what their looks I expect they might before long. When they do I'll be looking elsewhere for replacements.

mtsfly;Why aren't they weighted?;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;May 27, 2022;United States;"
I wish they were weighted on the opposite end from the handle as you are NOT able to rest it on a surface hands free because it will tilt towards the handle (so frustrating)!!!  Both sides should be the same weight so it is stable and can be used HANDS FREE. Not returning as I'll just have someone around the house help me when I need to use them or I'll donate.

Aruna;Fine strainers but warped in transit;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;March 23, 2019;United States;"
My daughter recommended these to me -- I bought them because the one she has are great.  I received mine but they were warped.  I thought maybe running them under hot water might bring it back to it's original, proper shape.  But no luck.  Since they are good quality and will last for a long time, I would prefer to have strainers that look good. I must return them for a replacement. They need better packaging.

MCC;good for sifting, irritating design choice;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;June 7, 2019;United States;"
These sifters work fine and don't get too clogged, but the smallest sifter doesn't nest inside the other two if you hang them from the hook. If you hang them from the long handle, the middle of the small sifter balances right on the rims of the other two, and if you hang it by the short loop its loop is much shorter so it angles way out.  I would not choose them again if I knew how poorly they'd all fit together

Horoscope Fish;Flimsy Construction;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;June 30, 2021;United States;"
Was expecting a much sturdier product. My decade old strainer recently popped a spot-weld and I was hoping these Cuisinart strainers would hold up as well as my old one. Based on what I got, I'm not at all hopeful. The strainer-head flexes dramatically at the slightest bit of pressure and the mesh itself is flimsy as well. Just nowhere near the quality I'm used to. This set will hold me over, but I expect I'll be replacing them sooner than later. Would return the ones I got but it's just not worth the hassle.

I do not like this product.  I have purchased all Cuisinart products.  I have every pot and pan and immersion tool and waffle maker so I thought instead of buying any other brand, I would buy the Cuisinart measuring cups.They do not clean well.  There is a shadow inside the cup.  They are not microwave safe.  I used one to soften some blueberries and my whole microwave was covered in blueberry syrup because the cup cracked and had a hole in it.What happened to the high standards?These just feel cheap.

Moo;Unsanitary, cheap garbage;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;July 23, 2022;United States;"
I was hoping a big box brand like Cuisinart would be better than the unpronounceable popup brands that appear and disappear constantly (I could swear I saw one called Aaooiimeie or something). No, this thing is horrible, flimsy, and a legitimate health hazard. Food gets trapped between the wire mesh and the metal rim constantly. Cleaning it practically requires dental tools, otherwise you're going to be getting food poisoning every time you use it. Pictured is just some of the food bits left after running the large strainer through the dishwasher twice, in different orientations. I'm so tired of picking out these kinds of bits with a toothpick. It's going in the trash now.

clarinet;Looks good but poorly constructed;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;January 7, 2022;United States;"
This review is of the largest of the three strainers in the order.  It worked great until the handle came off.  I would expect that a utensil like this could handle a load of rice -- ONE cup cooked rice -- but when I shook it to get the water out, the handle broke away.  Looking at where it was attached, I see a very weak-looking solder joint.  This handled the dry rice adequately, when I was rinsing it before cooking, but it's not acceptable that it would break under this heavier load that you could expect to be put in it.  Now I'll have to get another one and hope I find one that's less delicate, and now there is one more bit of junk to throw out.

The smaller sizes seem ok.  The handles are not welded tightly.  They are a little bendy.  The large one seems to be made of a much cheaper metal.  The screen came dented.  I can't get it to even back out.  I don't believe the strainer will be able to take any weight.  Will most likely send back.

Lisolet;Not Easy to Clean;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;November 27, 2020;United States;"
I like just about any Cuisinart product I have gotten but somehow this set of strainers have been disappointing. They strain fine just like any other strainer but they have a bad tendency of trapping food particles between the metal lip of the strainer and the mesh it connects with. This means that to make sure the strainer is properly clean the mesh has to be separated from the lip and hosed out after each use otherwise you end up with a pretty gross strainer. I am unsure why this gap was kept in the design as it make for an inefficient design.

There is a small gap between the metal net and the rim that traps small chunks of food. It is almost impossible to completely clean it. Every time I think I’ve scrubbed it down, it turns out the food bits just got flushed to the gap on the other end. Should have made the gap on the outside.

I don't have product complaints yet; they don't look like they could withstand much abuse, but my real complain is how Amazon sent them. I had ordered several items and Amazon sent them in one box. That's fine, but these were unprotected from heavier objects in the box and arrived with the mesh badly squished and bent. I carefully reshaped them, but the creases and dents are there to stay. Little dissapointed at the obviousness of what would happen to these during transit on the part of Amazon and that's not how I'd like new products to arrive.

Nora;Construction flaw;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;March 26, 2021;United States;"
I see now that others have commented about this. One of my main uses for the strainers is for washing small grains. Alas, these are constructed so they grains get stuck where the mesh (almost) meets the ring. No matter what I do, I can't get them all out and they fall out in storage. Creeps me out since insects are attracted, and the apartments I live in already have a bug problem.

These are inexpensive, and in that respect, they are worth it. But they aren't sturdy. I strained fruit through the largest strainer while making marmalade, and I could feel the strainer bend under the strain. Not much, and not like it was going to break on the spot, but clearly indicating that for heavy duty work, these aren't the necessary tools. If you're just straining a bit of flour, or some such, you're probably fine. Just don't expect these to be workhorses that will last through years of hard work.
