K_Indie Woods;Wrong Type of Spoon;0;;March 4, 2024;United States;"
The idea of this spoon is cute but the spoon they chose to engrave as a Mac'n Cheese spoon just does not work out. I ordered a similar spoon as a gift over the holidays and it was a nice big spoon. This one is the size of an iced tea spoon. It has a long handle and a small head to the spoon. My family has a set of these spoons that only get used for iced tea or root beer floats. This just isn't big enough for a big old scoop of mac'n cheese. On top of that the spoon that was chosen to be engraved was a very plain looking spoon. The others I had ordered in the past were high polished.I posted a picture of (in order l-r): a larger sized engraved spoon, this spoon, a teaspoon from my silverware drawer, one of our everyday teaspoons.The only thing that makes this giftable is the box. Once you lift the lid it a bit underwhelming.
