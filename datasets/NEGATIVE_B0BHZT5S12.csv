columbia93;Battery doesn't last very long & forget about using the case if you want to take photos;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 6, 2024;United States;"
This is my 3rd Fire 10 Tablet. They have a real sustainability problem and die before having them 3 years. Luckily it's not too expensive or I wouldn't bother. I'm already having to have this tablet replaced after less than a week, but Amazon's customer service was very helpful with it. Here's my thoughts in no particular order.1. Like the lilac color & that the covers have a translucent back.2. This tablet is nearly an 1"" smaller than my previous Kindle. Don't have a clue why, especially when tablets are now trending to 11"" because of the OS. Feels heavier, too.3. Because of the good deal on the 64MB, I purchased that and - finally - Kindle makes a bit more sense. With all of the bloatware you can't get rid of, especially the kid stuff when there is no kid in the house, I literally could only download a handful of apps. I can download so much more and still have room!4. The On/Off button has been moved to the left side. I don't get this. With the majority of people being right-handed, I don't understand why it was moved to where you have to reach across the tablet...especially if you want to take a screenshot.5. If you want to use the camera on the back, you'll have to remove the tablet from the cover. I can't recall where the camera was on the previous tablet because I didn't have a cover for it. Now, the lens is on the same side as the On/Off, which means when you fold back the cover, the lens is covered up! Who in the world didn't test this? The point of a cover is to make it easier to handle & provide some protection and in an action that literally is the riskiest move to make w/a tablet, Amazon has rendered either the camera useless, or the cover. I'd really like to know what they were thinking on this one.6. Battery life: Not good at all. Like I said, I've had 3 previous tablets - one 7"" and 2 10"" - and there's been a definite trend downward on battery life. I'm on it for several hours cumulative per day - playing a few apps, reading, ""X""...and I have to recharge at least once a day. It also feels like it takes a lot longer to charge than my previous tablet. I've had this plugged in for about 40 mins and it's gone from 13% to 28%. That's not great.7. A lot of apps are not longer viable. I don't think this is an issue with Amazon, just an issue with the new OS and developers not keeping up, so I'm guessing a lot of new tablets are having the same issues. Kinda sad. Some of these apps I've been playing for years and years!8. It took 10 days to arrive. I could have ordered some weird brand tablet and have it delivered literally that afternoon so I'm truly befuddled as to why ""2-day Delivery"" Amazon would force Fire purchasers to sit on their hands for that long. My tablet was in ""Order"" mode up until the evening before it was scheduled to be delivered. Why? We have a distribution center very near so...My mom has a Fire 10, I think 12th Gen, so I'll check this against hers, especially w/charging. Also, since my tablet appears to be defective, if this changes with the replacement, I'll update the review.  Again, this is just my thoughts on it and those things that bug me may not bug you!UPDATE: Amazon being Amazon. They lied. They won't ship it until Monday. So much for a responsive Customer Service. Removing a star.

I picked this up as an inexpensive Comixology-focused tablet primarily because of the inability to purchase from the Kindle store on iOS. For that purpose, the tablet serves pretty well. It's fast enough, can purchase directly from the Kindle store, and has expandable memory. If you're interested in also using third party comics subscription apps like DC Universe Infinite or Marvel Unlimited, however, you're not going to be happy. The locked down nature of the Kindle Fire HD 10 means you cannot install those apps without jumping through some hoops that I don't personally consider worth the effort.  Comixology Unlimited has a lot to offer, so it's not entirely a deal breaker, but this limitation can keep the Kindle from being your primary tablet for digital comics if you're a a subscriber to those other services. Three stars for its functionality. However...The Fire HD 10 is a cheaply made tablet. I knew that going in, but I didn't expect it to fail on me within a week of my purchase. After less than a week of ownership, I went to use it one day and as soon as I unlocked it, the screen rapidly faded to black and became unresponsive. I could occasionally wake it up, but the fade to black would still happen, which made it essentially useless for reading or watching anything. Occasionally it would mix it up and fade to a bright white, but in every case the tablet was useless. I tried to RMA for an exchange, but the automated system claimed that the HD 10 was sold to me by a third party seller (not the case) and that I would need to send it back, have a refund issued, and then buy another if I wanted. Having not had time to ship it back to Amazon, I experimented with it over the course of the next few days and was able to stabilize it with some percussive maintenance and made the decision to hold onto it.So what's WRONG with the HD 10? It's cheaply made. If the casing flexes in the right (wrong) way in your bag, presumably some connections become flakey and it affects the functionality of the display. If you're dead set on buying this tablet, I recommend a nice rigid case to protect it, because at the end of the day it's a bit fragile. I certainly didn't beat mine up, it simply couldn't handle a couple of bike commutes in a messenger bag. If you're okay with being soft locked into Comixology/Kindle and are okay with putting it into a heavier-duty case then I think this is a nice tablet for the price when you can pick it up on sale.

Paris;It's like a cool toy...;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 18, 2024;United States;"
I have had Samsung Galaxy products for years, but those are getting rather expensive. So I got this the other day for entertainment. It is definitely not android, but it's cool. It actually moves pretty fast, probably because it doesn't have as much unnecessary software as Galaxy products. This tablet is definitely primarily for reading and streaming. The three buttons on screen (back, home, recent) look so old and simple, but they work. The screen is pretty good too, not as good as the Galaxy A7 screen, but definitely functional. Its not the most responsive, but you may have to tap twice on more specific areas or text, again it feels like it's made for kids or older people. The tablet itself feels like a nice toy. It's very light, and feels almost hollow. It's definitely not a cutting edge innovative design. But it's not for that. This is a nice tablet for daily reading, entertainment streaming, kids, or in my case, going on a trip and I don't want to take my Mac Book. I can't imagine doing any kind of actual productivity work on this. But this is a fantastic extra curricular device for reading, streaming videos, or some light writing if you have the keyboard attachment. If you have kids, or expect to carry this around with you, or put it in bags, you need some kind of case because it doesn't seem too durable. BUT at this price...if you break it, or lose it...just get another one LoL I definitely would.

Simone;Do not purchase the tablet with home screen Ads!;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 8, 2024;United States;"
I purchased the tablet with Home Screen Ads because it was cheaper, but it’s been a complete nightmare. I needed a tablet for my daughter to use for educational apps that I purchased, so I didn’t want anything fancy or too expensive. After all, she has other devices to use for playing games & etc. I’ve purchased several Fire tablets in the past and never had an issue until now.The first night my daughter used it, she kept complaining about ads, but when she showed it to me, there weren’t any ads popping up.Today, I grabbed her tablet during my downtime to download the apps and set up Night Zookeeper on her tablet and it was ad after ad! I couldn’t do anything without an ad popping up every 20 seconds. Every time I clicked on a page or app, an ad would pop up!!!!I placed a return and found out I need to box it up with the label before returning. The tablet came in a Amazon bag. So now I now I have to spend extra money to return it. Waste of time!

R2;Big and heavy compared to previous Fire;Digital Storage Capacity: 64 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 21, 2024;United States;"
Updated review: now that I've had a day to actually use this new Fire, I don't like it very much. As stated below it is big, heavy and awkward to hold while sitting. The font sizes are limited and some look way too tiny for such a big tablet; if you choose the largest of five, then some thing like ebooks are HUGE while the icons are a good size. I am so disappointed that I wish I hadn't let the return window expire, even though i bought this on sale. I guess I'll be it to a family member.I bought this newest Fire to replace my much loved and very used kindle fire from the previous version when itarted to get a bit glitchy from being dropped so many times. Definitely larger and definitely heavier. Not nearly as portable as the other Fire because unfortunately, it is too big to go in most of my purses! Sad face. Therefore it's not really getting used as it's pretty heavy for arthritic hands to hold to read books but if you want it to watch movies/stream content from the web, this new Fire is a good choice.

Shannon Harper;Cheaply made…;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: OceanStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;March 5, 2024;United States;"
This is my 3rd Kindle Fire…I think the previous 2 were the 8 and 11.  Both of them ended the same way—one day they just wouldn’t wake up.  No drops, extreme temps, children using them, wrapped in cases their entire lives….just dead after about 3 years.  So it was time to order a new one.  Ordered the newest one (13th gen).  First thing I noticed was the 1st time I had to replace Amazon sent me a box to ship the old one back in and a discount on the new one—this time only the discount.  On my own for the box.  Last time it was delivered practically overnight—this time had to wait 4 days.  Not a super long time except for the fact there is an Amazon distribution center less than 5 miles from my house.  I finally get it and open the box…one of the things that is hyped up is how light it is.  It is very light—but it feels cheap because the plastic feels a lot thinner.  I ordered a case for it that has the light magnet just for closing purposes.  First thing that happens is one of the metal tabs comes off the kindle and is stuck to the case.  Seems to work ok but I am not holding out hope that this Kindle will last as long as the last two.

Shervin;Right Size | Includes 3.5mm Audio Input + USB-C | No Simultaneous Charging & Accs Support;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;January 27, 2024;United States;"
I downgraded from the Max 11 2023 latest version because that version was simply too big, had only one USB-C input that you could ONLY use for either charging or connecting an accessory. It also had tons of bugs with touchscreen such as scrolling up and down with your fingers being mistaken as a click. At one time I lost the touchscreen completely. The unit was not responding to anything. I had to connect a wired mouse via USB-C to get the unit to restart and resolving the issue. Otherwise, the unit would be locked out completely. There is no external reset button on that model either.This one (Version 10, 2023) that I am reviewing here doesn't have the above issues, smaller but the right size and manageable specially for closeup work and applications. I found the Max 11 to be too big.  However, the issue with lack of support for simultaneous charging and connecting a wired accessory via a USB-C splitter adapter remains. You have to only use bluetooth accessories like the one Amazon want you to use. This is a terrible and dreadfully limiting feature.Forcing the user to only use  bluetooth means they have to discard perfectly serviceable wired accessories that would otherwise work with the unit. Bluetooth is not always desirable or convenient plus it adds further risk of radiation exposure that is otherwise eliminated with a wired accessory.  Some people can actually get headaches when exposed to a close and constant sources of bluetooth emitting devices. There are also security issues that are beyond the scope of this review.In the next variant of this product, Amazon should build a simultaneous support for charging and adding an accessory via its only USB-C input via a adapter like the one I've attached a photo of or simply offer several USB-C inputs; one for accessory, one for charging.In my case I have a wired keyboard that is super ergonomic with built in USB inputs of its own that allow you to connect a mouse directly into it, hence you only need one input into any device to use both keyboard and a mouse without the needing of several inputs. The keyboard pass on any USB device connection connected to it to a device you connect it to.  With this current version, you can only use an accessory or charge, not both.

RaisinBran;Disappointed in this version of Fire tablet.;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;February 26, 2024;United States;"
I have purchased 6 Fire tablets over the years. They have all been reliable workhorses and excellent devices for movies, music and media. I have used my Fire 8 for heavy work research and extremely active social media and blog posting. No, you can't use these devices to edit films or create graphic art like iPads, but you get a ridiculously great value for top notch media consumption and reliable performance for all web browsing.Until now.I am so disappointed in this version of the Fire tablet.  The audio is substantially worse than previous versions, including audio from plugged in headphones and earbuds, not just the device speaker.The performance SUCKS. I've had my device for only one day and I've had to reboot 6 times because Audible freezes and won't play. Audible!? Audible is a standard Amazon app that should be fairly bulletproof at this point in Fire tablet history.I also really dislike the new nightshade filter. The almost orange-brown hue of previous tablets actually worked to block blue light. Many of us with light sensitivity issues appreciated that old filter. Yes, it made the screen orange, but it also REALLY prevented eye strain. The new tablet is vaguely amber, similar to the Iphone night shade, and does nothing for my sensitive eyes, even when turned up to the max level.  Others likely find the new night shade appearance an improvement over the former orange screen, but I miss how soothing it was.The new Fire also has terrible connection to WiFi.  Nothing in my house has changed but unlike previous tablets this one can't stay connected.  I even sat right next to my WiFi hub, and the device kept dropping connection.I've noticed a lag when typing, too, that no other tablet had.If you have never owned be previous Fire tablst you might not notice the changes, but if you've loved your previous versions, dont get this ""upgrade.""UPDATE:It is not just my Fire 10 device.  I spoke with 2 friends who ""upgraded"" -- one for their children and one for an older mom.  The speakers and internal audio on all devices are USELESS.  Kids can't hear movies in the car and barely in quiet room unless right up against speaker. No headphones or ear buds can be turned up loud enough.  My friend's older mom with audiology-measured MILD hearing loss (no hearing aid required) can't understand language unless holding device speaker up to her ear, which negates how she wanted to use it for Alexa, Zoom calls and YouTube recipes in the kitchen.I still have a functional Fire 7. The speaker can be heard in the next room. The 8 I still have in my office is great for music and videos. Not as good as the 7, but still functional. Both Re on par with my iphone 14 and gaGalaxy phone speakers. To use the Fire 10 I and the two others I know with this version have to connect to external bluetooth speakers.Amazon devices keep getting shortchanged from their original offerings. My daughter's 7 year old regular kindle has better text visibility than my new one.  How much profit is enough, Amazon?The other bugs in the 10 continue to frustrate me. Audible  won't consistently work, the device crashes, text input often lags.Get the 8 instead! And hopefully Fire's next iteration won't suck.

Keep Trying;Audio is inadequate and distorted.;Digital Storage Capacity: 64 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: OceanStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 22, 2024;United States;"
Traded in my Fire 10th gen 8"" because the battery was not lasting as long any more. The price was so good I bought this 13th gen Fire 10.1"" tablet. The old one fit in one hand and the speakers - although not perfect - were clear enough to listen to podcasts at night, when turned up to maximum volume. The new one is heavy and too big to hold comfortably in one hand. The worst part is max volume is not loud and some podcasts are so distorted that I no longer understand the words. I now find myself using a MOTO power phone to listen to the podcasts. The sound from this tiny in comparison device is infinitely better. That is why 3 stars at best. Please upgrade the speakers to something reasonable. Also cannot use this for Babbel language practice. Volume is too low to hear clearly. Almost makes this a brick without a purpose.

I bought this tablet because, with discounts, it was cheaper than upgrading my Kindle.  As a reader with added features, it is fine. It's a nice piece of hardware.  But with all that this is capable of, Amazon has chosen to limit its capabilities.  The SD card is not only formatted in FAT32, but it is useless in any other device.  So transferring any data at all from another device my not be impossible, but it is so difficult as to be impractical.  Android apps at Amazon cost as much as 4X what they cost at Google Play.  Why?If you need a fully functioning tablet that allows you to use it in the manner that you choose, then find an alternative, even if it costs more.  If you just want to access your kindle library and other media from Amazon, then this will please you.

I was excited to get this All-new Amazon Fire HD10 tablet.  This is the third one I have purchased, thinking it would be an upgrade from my current Fire HD10 Plus 11th Generation purchased in December 2022.  I keep upgrading every couple of years with the great trade-in offers from Amazon, so I thought this would be my next upgrade.Unfortunately, despite the marginal improvement the video resolution and processor speed, the lack of wireless charging was a deal breaker for me.  The USB charging port has always been a persistent failure point in past devices due to repeated plugging and unplugging of the tablet during use.  I find the wireless charging feature works great for me with a generic AT&T charger plugged in on my bedside table so I returned the new Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet within a few days for a refund.

Please read whole review...I have an old Apple device that needed replacing. For various reasons I didn't go for a new one. I have a relative that got a Fire 7. They seem to be happy with theirs.  So, got a Fire HD 10.  Set-up was fairly easy & quick. I liked the size & the feel.  So I sat down and wrote down all that I wanted to load onto my NEW tablet.  I was only 1/3 through my list when the memory got full. So I griped some. But I had a SD card that I loaded up. Then I went about working on my list.  A few days after I had placed the SD card in I decided to check how full I was.  I was at 34G. that just hit me wrong. So, I got the breakdown of how much was music vs. photos vs. Apps, so forth.  I was just over 2G of music! That was 98% of what I downloaded...The reason I got the device...THE reason I put in the SD card because I that I had maxed-out the memory!!!...  According to the SD listing 30G was Apps!?!?!  I did NOT add any Apps. So I checked to see what was loaded... ACCORDING to the read-out There are NO!!! Apps. It just created space to store any Apps I may add later.  So, 30G for Apps & 2G for music.  Correct me if I am wrong. But...I got a 32G tablet that was ALREADY  at peak capacity at roughly 30G BEFORE I even started loading my music choices!!!  THAT people is WRONG! Period. end of statement.  Now...Battery life, screen picture quality, ease of web browsing have been fine. A hiccup here or there. But, I have only had it like a fortnight or so. I can write most of that up to learning a new device.

The best thing about Android is its openendedness.Not the case with the new firmware. They lock you into OTA updates, force you to use their garbage launcher, force their in house bloat ware on your system that is DEEPLY integrated into the OS itself.You can get around SOME of the headache, but with the firmware lock down it will constantly reset itself because of the updates you have no say in accepting.It's only worth it at the big spring sale price point.If you're paying full price get yourself a proper android tablet that Amazon hasn't used as a glorified portable marketing device.Amazon needs to do better.

Kindle Customer;Streaming media player, not an eBook reader;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 21, 2024;United States;"
I'm rather disappointed with this version of the Kindle Fire HD 10. I bought it when my older Kindle Fire HD 10 from 2017 seemed to be getting slow, and I figured it was time for an upgrade. I mostly used it to read news sites and webpages, with a bit of content creation for social media.Now, when I hear ""Kindle"" I think ""eBook reader."" When I fired this model up after I took it out of the package I was immediately struck with how TV-like it was in dimensions and even default orientation. The Kindle logo that comes on the screen at boot up time demands you hold it in a very un-booklike orientation where it's wider than it is tall.This seemed like a peculiarity, but something I could work with as it was smart enough to rotate, but it turns out this was just a hint of a specific design choice.When I started going to the same websites I used to go to with my older model I frequently found them so badly formatted that the ads extended over the text, making it illegible.It very quickly became obvious: This is a streaming video consumption device that can be used as an eBook reader and light website viewer (sometimes), not an eBook reader and website reader that can be used as a streaming video consumption device.Because of it's focus on viewing video, you can't ever completely mute it. There are things that will always make it sound off, maybe very quietly, but it isn't possible to completely stop it's noise. For example, if you power it off or on, it will make some noise. That was disappointing, but since it isn't loud enough to wake my partner I was okay with it.So I finally got around to creating some content on it, and was very disappointed that this new video watching tablet I had inadvertently purchased was no faster than my old model from 7 years ago when editing or compressing video. In fact, it sometimes took longer to compress a video.So, here's the upshot: This might be a good device for someone who only wants to use it to watch Amazon Prime movies, but if you want to quietly read the news in the morning, or if you want to work on your social media, get something else. This isn't your tablet.

I was in need of a replacement for an Android type tablet and went with the Amazon Fire solely based on the fact that my primary app use is Audible, figuring that an Amazon service like Audible would work great on their own tablet.  Big mistake.  While the other features and apps on the tablet work fine, Audible is slow and buggy.  It takes twice as long for content to load and after my last system update, it dumped every single title I had downloaded.  This will be a 1x learning experience for me; I will avoid Amazon devices in the future.

I bought my fire a week ago, I love the size and wanted it to read newsletters etc.  I like the size and the weight.  My biggest problem is I, tried to download some of my standard apps and found out Amazon doesn't allow them or doesn't have them in there play store. I can't get any of my favorite Google apps. I do get my email but no calender and I don't want two calenders. I can't get to my files on Google drive and I am not copying my files over to Amazon, oddly they are probably on an AWS cloud. No contacts can't get my Google contacts. I use Google translate since I travel frequently to Germany and Amazon translate is honestly far behind Google translate. For example, Google translate can translate an entire paragraph only a word at a time. The problem is that words take on different meanings depending on context.Now here is something interesting Amazon does play well with Microsoft, I can get all my excel, word, etc. I also can use both Bing and Google for searches so that is a push.

Probably the most average tablet but considering the price you can't expect more. Purchased to replace an iPad that met the tile floor and shattered. Unfortunately that ipad still functions better than the Fire tablet. The touch screen requires a hard press to open apps or pause videos. Picture quality is fine. Seems like it takes a while to charge the battery but the battery does seem to last. If you need a decent tablet for media viewing, this will work. Nothing fancy but it does the job.

Just a note that these devices are for personal use, not commercial.  We were hoping to use them to help in education at some of our trade shows, but will have to find other solutions.That being said, the tablets are light, have a bright, clear screen and are fairly easy to use.PROSLightweight, Large, clear screen. Decent sound.CONSJanky policy for businesses. Battery life is abysmal - looks like it will drain on idle after 48 hours.Proprietary stuff, harder to configure, some software will not install. It's an Android, but it's not an Android.  Accessories are pretty expensive considering it's a $100 tablet.

Overall the Fire HD 10 is a good simple tablet for the price. It is well built and no issues with damage like many other reviews had. It’s definitely a low end tablet mainly good for reading and general browsing but overall worth the money and a great tablet.

10"" screen is smaller than 11th generation 10"" screen.  They call both this generation and the 11th generation Fire 10.1"" screen, but the new one is actually a different size, a half inch shorter.  I'm hoping this is the ONLY thing they've cut corners on or I'll be returning it for a refund posthaste.  I had nothing but problems with the last one, but the one I bought for my son worked great, so hopefully just a fluke.  I have to admit, though, I was torqued when I realized the screen size was smaller.  This is the third generation Fire I've had, and with each succeeding purchase, the quality has gone down.  Fingers crossed.  I'll update as time goes on.

I've had this Amazon Fire 10 for several months and do not use it for any online banking thank goodness.  I've installed very few applications, and all from the Amazon App Store.  It now has malware on it and I can't find a trusted source to remove it.  The pop-ups happen so fast it's hard to focus on anything that might help.  I keep uninstalling applications that I didn't install.  As careful as I am with downloading anything, it's disappointing to have to deal with this.  I could use some help or it will be going into the trash and I won't buy another one (this is the third).

The 2021 version was so much better. Not laggy and pretty fast. Over time tho they wear out. So I got the 2023 version since my older one was getting slow. .... My 2021 kindle is still better than the new one in comparison. I even got this 1 a memory card. But is potentially useless. Because every time I turn off the kindle it says that I ejected my memory card when I did not. And I have to take the case off, take it out and put it back If I if I want to use it. Which is bullcrap. The new 1 has so many more glitches and it's so much more laggy. I'm sort of wishing that I had gotten the 2021 version again. They call it the relaxation kindle. I'm not sure How other people relax. Maybe it plays music OK I don't really know. I usually just play games on it and check my email. And I shop on amazon as well on my kindle. So if I'm having glitches with just that. That's so sad. It's really sad that my old worn out kindle that's 3 years old works better than the new one. Do better Amazon.

I purchased a fire HD 10 on February 25, 2024. I liked the size, display and feel of the tablet. However, the tablet had a problem with the dark mode. I could not get the dark mode to turn off. More importantly, the bluetooth was worthess. The device would pair with other devices, but would never connect with the other devices. I called customer support, and the tech connected to my tablet, and after 30 minutes or so could not figure out the problem (but agreed there was a definite connection problem, so she wrote a ticket to send to another department, and I was told that I would be contacted within 72 hours. Time passed, and no contact. So I called again. The second representative was rude and dismissive. He wrote a repair ticket, which apparently is different that the ticket the first representative wrote, and told e to have a nice day. After thinking about it for 10 minutes, I decided I did not want a tablet which was in my hands for less than 30 days repaired. So I called again, got a pleasant, responsibe representative, and was able to return the tablet for a full refund. I would like to try another fire HD 10, but am a little leery. The rude, dismissive rep has knd of soured me. plus, after doing some research, I see others have had an issue with  bluetooth connection on several versions of the tablet. If bluetooth were not important, and if the dark mode worked properly, this would be a wonderful tablet. As I write this, I see Amazon has the fire hd 10 at $45.00 off the regular price.

Lots of people travel for their work. I am no exception.

i had a 10"" fire tablet since ~2015. it's battery finally got difficult to charge, and i don't see how to change the battery, so i bought a new one. set up was easy, the screen is the same, i was happy until i realized that it will not play videos. the thing will buffer for i don't know how long (have not pushed it past 10 min....). restarting helps but not for long. it's awful to have to restart every 15 min or so when on social media or youtube. i may have to send this thing back.update: a support person called then emailed. which was nice. sadly every email is answered by a different person. tho that may not have made much difference. the first couple of helpers started with the 'do a restart' or 'go read this forum' like i'd been doing. sigh. one person finally suggested that i uninstall and re-install my tablet on my network to address the buffering. weird but i did it and had nearly 3 days of no buffering!! within 2.5 hrs of me emailing the support person my good news, the damn thing started buffering again. re-starts still correct the issue and i can go a day or so before having to restart. but today i have restarted the tablet 3X. i recently got a Fire HD10 plus tablet that has not given me a moments trouble so far (this device is on the exact same networks that the troublesome one is on). it's now too late to send this tablet back, and i would prefer it be replaced with the HD10 plus which i doubt will happen, so i'll keep it as a spare because it's fine except for the effing video playback.

If you are planning on buying box sets like the lord of the rings, eragon, wheel of time, discworld, hyperion, mistborn, foundation series, robot series, or other sets, you should know that the sets are not available on kindle, meaning you WILL have to buy paperback books for those sets (which is cheaper) Or spend MORE money on the kindle versions. Some of them don't even have the whole series available on kindle as singles. So if your main strategy was to move completely to digital reading, look into the books you're planning to buy before you buy a kindle Fire and make sure you even can buy kindle versions. If those are your first book purchases you'll be making, wait to buy a kindle because they are not available on unlimited or as kindle purchases for a set for a cheaper price. Wheel of time specifically is not available on kindle as singles, and is much more expensive than the box sets. Found this out after I returned the paperbacks when I bought a kindle thinking I could buy the sets at the same price on kindle, no such luck so ill be returning my kindle fire until I have read the books I want to that do not cost more to own a kindle just to read or can't read at all.

Got it for $90 and it’s worth about that. Purchased to use on a flight for in-flight entertainment. Hard to believe, but most airlines don’t have entertainment devices on board anymore. Now you need to use your own device.On top of that, I had the challenge of getting the airline application installed on this device. The Amazon App Store doesn’t have as many apps as the play store. I had to side load the Hawaiian Airlines app in order for it to install on this device. Once installed, it worked OK on the flight. But I could tell that this tablet was having difficulty keeping up with some of the video during the movie. It uses the chrome browser and the horsepower of this tablet just isn’t that strong.If you’re looking for an affordable tablet to browse the web and do some light gaming, this might work for you. But don’t pay full price for it.

Pros -1. Lower price compared to iPad.2. Has option with or without ads to save some money.3. Preinstalled amazon apps and synced with account before shipped.4.

Sometimes freezes on ad screen and needs to be restarted3. Doesn't automatically readjust and display when you turn from portrait to landscape mode. Shows error and forces you to rotate tablet to view content4. Unable to install ad-block on Silk browser and could be annoying when visiting websites.5. Limited apps available for installation.Note: I haven't installed a SD card yet. Reading from other reviews it could be a hit or miss to use SD card and expand memory.Overall it is cheaper.

My daughter has issue with her eyes but loves to read. So instead of getting her a Kindle with a 6” screen, we opted for the Fire with the 10.5” screen plus I have Kindle Unlimited, Amazon Prime and lots of other things I can share with her. The unfortunate thing is (and I had no idea until I was setting up her account), is that from ages 14-17, Kindle isn’t supported on the Amazon Fire. I either have to give her adult permissions at 15yrs old, or give her 13 year old permissions. We are keeping it because I can funnel books to her by listing her as a child BUT a lot of the other functionalities are cut off from her where they wouldn’t be if I could list her proper age. I am disappointed to say the least.

This is a pretty good product, though there are some actions that are not intuitive. For example, if you load your own videos to watch, they go into the ""videos"" folder within the ""files"" folder, which is not a problem, But when you watch them, there is no navigation bar to fast forward or to move to a different location in the video. Also, the files do not order in the folder the way you might think. I put numbers in the name, and the ""1s"" line up first (i..e., 1, 11, 12, 13...) before moving to the ""2s"" (2, 20, 21, 22...). This is a bit irritating when you want to watch in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...). Other than this, admittedly minor irritation with watching my own uploaded videos, I find this to be a great item for an inexpensive tablet. I primarily use to watch movies while using treadmill or elliptical, and it is great for this (can pair bluetooth earbuds), and we've even used it to watch movies in the car on a long trip, paired through the car's stereo (driver not watching).

This my second Fire 10 Tablet.  Love my 2021 11th Gen.  My main reason for it's purchase was to play SimCity Build-It.  It's odd cause at times when you swipe it lags behind.  You get the comet trail while it tries to catch up.  I've seen other reviews say it ""lags"".  Not sure if it's just the game or all other apps.  But oddly enough the internet features in the game always seem quick and responsive.  I've only watched a second or two of video but it seems high quality & has a beautiful visual display.  Also it very hot one time.  Can't remember what pop up happened but an Amazon System Function caused it.  I googled it & there were all sorts of others experiencing the same thing.  I ended the process, rebooted it & it got back to normal.  I returned the tablet.  They sent another & it has the same habits.  But at black friday $79 it a good buy.  But it's not nearly as good as the 11th Gen.

This is the newest of their 10-in tablets and they should have stuck to the old. First off the speakers are very weak and very hard to hear sometimes. you can't make them any louder or adjust any kind of base or trouble. Second off you can't use many of the apps with this unit. I can't use my banking app or two of my credit card apps. Since Amazon doesn't have a decent weather app in their app store I've always used the weather channel app but I can no longer use it with this tablet so now I am left without any kind of weather notice. It does seem to respond quickly and the resolution seems fine. It's just a very hard to use because you can't use the things you want. Very disappointing. I won't say not to buy this tablet but I will say to be very careful on your decision. For me I won't buy it again without improvements I would go for the older tablets which I never had any trouble with. I think they release this tablet too soon and didn't work out all the problems with it. I was being generous giving it two stars I should have just given it one but it does seem to have an improved resolution and I would like it if I could get it to work for me. After all the purpose of buying a computer or tablet is to use it for your own use not for Amazon use. All in all bye at your own risk. Investigate it thoroughly before you decide. Maybe they'll come out with an upgrade soon I hope so

The price on sale makes this a no brainer.  It's too bad the overall speed has not improved as much as it should have over my 2017 model.  The amazon browser if pathetically slow at loading any complicated pages and this is with 250mbs internet speed.The most disappointing thing was that when I moved my 128MB SD card from my old HD10 to the new one, it was unrecognized and had to be reformatted losing all my videos and music. You would think that amazon would try for some backwards compatibility.  I mean windows will still read floppy disks!I do love the color though!

Purchased this product before Christmas with the recommended screen protector. After trying 2 protectors, was unable to get a good fit & work out the air bubbles. Purchased another set of 2 protectors (different brand) and had same issue. Actually tried a round 3 of another pair/another brand & took it to the Verizon store & the worker couldn’t make it fit.This new fire screen does not fit for any screen protectors I tried. Wasted a lot of money trying! I returned this one. Recommend sticking to older models until they work this out.

Some apps on my older version Fire tablet are no longer available.  This one seems faster, but the design is lack luster.  The older version had silver buttons on black which made them easier to see.  This version has black buttons on black which makes them VERY DIFFICULT to see.  I am constantly pressing the side buttons by mistake.  Maybe this is an upgrade, but the design was poorly thought out.  The matching cover is just as bad.

Set up the new kindle, but the apps from another kindle won't load.  So far I have talked with two kindle tech reps and they haven't been able to fix this problem.  Very annoying.  The last rep said it seems to be an ongoing problem, so maybe a glitch in the kindle itself.  I have had many kindles and this is the first time I've had a problem with the apps transferring.The 3 stars are only because of this problem.  The kindle itself is nice.Later.  I did finally get a tech that helped.  The problem now is it freezes at times.  Of all the kindles I've had I like this one the least.  Plus I don't like the power button on the left side.  Next time I'll watch for that.

Product came fast and effectively. However, upon opening the package the charging block and cord were missing.

First and foremost the tablet only supports FAT32 file system for storage devices when the standard for over a decade and a half has been exFAT.If you have a modern smartphone(yes even a budget one) it likely supports the exFAT file systemAccording to Guru99.com and other sources, ""FAT32 is one of the oldest of the three file systems availableto Windows. It was introduced in 1996 on Windows 95 to replace the FAT16 file system usedwith older OS systems like DOS and Windows 3.""FAT32 limitations:-individual files on a FAT32 storage device cannot exceed 4 Gigabytes (GB) in size(keep in mind, A 1080p HD 30-60 fps movie that runs for 2.5 hours can exceed 4 GB)The chart below is from PCMag: NTFSMaximum File Size: 16TBMaximum Volume Size: 256TBMaximum Number Of Files: 4.3G exFATMaximum File Size: 16EBMaximum Volume Size: 64ZBMaximum Number Of Files: **(Limited By Volume Size) FAT32Maximum file size: 4GBmaximum volume size: 2TBmaximum number of files: 4M FAT16Maximum file size: 4GBmaximum volume size: 4GBmaximum number of files: 65K (** = limited by volume size)To put things in perspective the Extended File Allocation table (or exfat) allows files of 16EB = 16,000,000,000 GB (16,000,000 TB)So why is Amazon limiting their user? people are speculating that they don't want you to bring your own content onto your own devices but rather using their content instead with their highly customizedandroid operating system that doesn't even support the Google services in which our apps that we've paid for are attached to. Not to mention there apps aren't very high-quality with their YouTube appbeing nothing more than a link to the actual site instead of the actual application. It took me hours to figure out how to get Google on their as well as some of the Google services which still don't really work properly withsome services not working at all despite android being owned by GoogleMy personal experience:exFAT surpasses FAT32 in reading and writing speedwhen transferring data from my computer to an NVMe storage device formatted with exFAT speeds were up to 300 MB/s (NOT megabits)After needing to reformat it with the fire tablet HD10 2023 because it claimed it was corrupt when it really wasn't because it just doesn't support exfat,I went to my computer to the move the files again and the speed went all the way down to 38.9 MB/s (again not megabits).I checked the formatting..... GUESSS WHAAT??? It was FAT32!! SMH

I am an avid reader and this is my newest of at half-dozen kindles. When I originally started having issues, I contacted support and they eventually sent me a new one to replace the one with the problems... The support people were great. Unfortunately, the replacement is performing much like the original. It loses WiFi for no reason quite frequently. There is a phantom email download that starts a few times a day without me even opening my email. And it freezes, often while I am trying to turn a page while reading. Also, sometimes it won't charge even thought the usb-c is in correctly and completely.I love my kindles, but they usually only last a year or two. I even bought the memory upgrade and no-ad option , so that was exciting. But the little glitches make me wish I had just bought the same one I had before.

Update (12/2/2023)So a tech person from Amazon called the day after I posted my 1-star review (below).  He was concerned about the poor review and said the original Fire tablet was defective and it was replaced.  He said the business with moisture in the charge port should not happen (which actually conflicts with the error messages, which say the problem is caused even without moisture if you use a ""third party"" charger or cable).  Hmm, Amazon, that's the problem exactly - if I wanted a device that needed a specific cable I would have bought an Apple.  It should charge with ANY standard USB cable and charger.  Also won't work with battery chargers.Unfortunately I'm having the exact same problem with the replacement tablet using any of several different high-end chargers (Superdanny) and battery chargers all of which work fine with all my other phones and devices, including 7"" Fire tablets.  I see no reason to change my review - the only charger that works with the Fire is the one that came with it. Really makes it pretty much useless unless I leave it home.Original Review (11/20/2023)The new Fire tablets have something called a ""moisture sensor"" in the charging port.  It unfortunately disables any cable/charger combination that is not the Amazon charger that came with the device, no moisture.  It basically means you have to carry the Amazon charger and cable around just for this one device. If you forget to bring it on a trip you're out of luck.  You can't use the standard USB charger or battery charger or a standard USB-C cable, all of which you can use with any Android phone or tablet or ebook reader, among other gadgets that require USB power.  For some strange reason the only Android device that has this problem is the Amazon Fire tablet.Even weirder is that there is no way to tell whether you have a compatible charger except by trying it.  At least an Apple charger looks different so you know it won't work. If a particular charger or USB-cable is not compatible with your Fire tablet you get a message saying there's moisture in the charge port -OR- you're using a ""third party"" charger and you should use an Amazon charger. This is really strange as I have never even heard previously of problems with moisture in USB devices.  This design flaw really lowers the utility of this tablet to a sort of useless toy that's not very practical or reliable enough for general use.  Charging is completely unreliable.An ongoing problem for the Fire ecosystem is you can't get certain apps that are standard for Android devices for Fire devices.  An example is 1Password, probably the most commonly used password app available.  I've  seen complaints going back to 2015 that it's not available for Fire devices.

The status bars things are now red instead of blue.  That is going to take some getting used to. My solitaire game is gone, and I have tried three new games, and all of them have touch response that is so lagging I might as well be wearing mittens. I downloaded Hulu and it signs me out daily, requiring a new login code - even though it knows my login and password. Frustrating.I am not sure about the battery - its not awesome though. The control buttons are on the bottom now, which is also frustrating, since I keep instinctively reaching for volume and push the power button. Why? Why did they change it? Other than that, its fine.

I would recommend doing your research before buying if you have a specific purpose in mind for this tablet. For instance, I bought with the intent of using for my Canva creating as well as diamond painting and cross stitch. Well…none of the apps I use for these activities are available through the Amazon App Store.  In fact, quite a few of the apps I looked for were not available. I even searched for alternative apps for some of my favs…those were not available either! If you want to read, it’s great, but if you want to do anything more…not so much. It is literally feels like an updated Kindle reader with internet access.

Edit to add: I’m so disgusted with this Fire tablet. At first it kept disconnecting from WiFi when it was near my wireless printer. The experts chimed in and sent me an email saying I shouldn’t have it that close to another WiFi device. Spoiler alert, none of my other connected devices are compromised by my printer. Now it won’t load Paramount+. I opened and streamed Paramount+ on all my other devices and yet it’s the tablet it won’t work on. I offloaded the app and tried to add it again and it won’t even do anything when I click on the download app button. I’m so over this. It was cheap, yes, but it’s been nothing but a headache.I bought this five days ago, specifically to stream apps like Peacock and Paramount+, etc. I was sick of using my phone when I was away from my TV, like when I'm cooking and cleaning. I have high speed internet and none of my other devices buffer or disconnect. I don't know what the problem is, but my Kindle either buffers several times an episode, or it says it ""requires an active internet connection"". So ALL my other devices have no issues, but the Kindle does? I was wondering why it was only $94 and now I know. I didn't buy it for the price, I just wanted a brand new Kindle. It just happened to be way less expensive than I expected. I'm beginning to think it was reduced because it sucks.

If you're considering purchasing an Amazon Fire HD be aware that their apps are great...for senior citizens and children. I had a Kindle years ago and they are STILL offering many of the SAME janky apps from that era. Functionality for this tablet is greatly diminished when you aren't able to install productive apps or your favorite games. No Play Store. No Dropbox. No alternate browsers. BUT I CAN WATCH CARTOONS AND PLAY SUDOKU.Stop letting the boomers tamper with the customers ability to choose for themselves what they do and do not want on their tablets and this would be an unbelievable product.
