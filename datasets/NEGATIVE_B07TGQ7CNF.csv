Caleb Richardson;Fragile switches and caps;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Red – Linear & Quiet;Verified Purchase;February 25, 2024;United States;"
The keyboard is good in quality and is made well except the switch stems and key caps, if you're rough on keyboards or accidentally push the key cap too far the stem of the switch will break in half or the keycap guides will break off.

UPDATE: After using better quality mechanical keyboard, I’ve realized how poor this keyboard performs.  The keycaps are thin, the stabilizers are rickety etc. . Worst of all the switches started failing in less than 3 years! So frustrating. Do some research and get yourself find a high-quality mechanical keyboard instead.Really like this keyboard.  With brown switches it’s a very light touch for standard typing but is also good for gaming. Perfect feel for me.  It is more clicky than my old MS keyboard for sure but it’s not obnoxious.I really like that you can set different colors for each and every key.  I use this so I can more quickly find where the line of numbers are vs Fkeys and also put different colors on the movement keys (like backspace, delete, return, alt ctrl etc.)  and disable keys like shift-lock and INS which I never use but keep the option to put them back in use with the simple switch of the profiles.Which brings me to my one and only issue.The software for managing the keyboard has a few MAJOR BUGS that caused me to lose a lot of work setting up profiles.  After setting up a few profiles,  I wanted to look at some of the built in profiles which you can do using the ""illumination"" menu on the small OLED screen.  The problem is, once I did that, it overwrote my profile.  This happened multiple times after using the mini screen to load profiles as well. And I made SURE I was doing a LOAD PROFILE and not a SAVE PROFILE.  But very odd things happened going back and forth between the OLED screens settings/profile/etc. menues and loading up the SteelSeries Engine software. I would find my old profile names replaced, names copied from one profile to another and just completely wiped out.To avoid this issue I keep a number of backups of my profiles so that if it gets wiped out again, I can seem to use the SteelSeries Engine to load one of my backups and then use the mini OLED screen to Save Profile etc. But its a big pain. I have found that if you just avoid using the OLED screen menus to load up illuminations/presets or use it to change profiles you will probably be ok.  But I know there are some pointer issues or memory leaks or bad de-references in the software because sometimes my profile name will get overwritten with a name I never even typed that looks like a join of other names. Also, the name of the extra configs that you create.... those names will be overwritten with the names of the names of the build in profiles etc. So, some major bugs in the software really take away from an otherwise great experience.TIP to SteelSeries: Run your software through a good static analysis tool (i.e. SonarQube) and fix the bugs.UPDATE: Works great for one computer for the second computer in tin used to reset and I have found no solution even though I have exhaustively looked on the Internet for a solution. The only workaround for the reset is to unplug it and plug it back in which is totally annoying. Therefore I drop the rating. It’s unfortunate but it works so well on one computer it’s so poorly on another.FINAL UPDATE: I found that using USB 2.0 connections worked better than USB 3.0 connections. Also using a USB-C switch/KVM will likely cause problems. So if you’re using with a single computer and find the USB connection that works, It’s gonna be a great keyboard. However, you may find the notorious  repeating reset bug which makes the keyboard unusable. I had to buy a separate USB 2.0 switch and connect to USB 2.0 connections in order to use this with two computers. Kind of a big pain but I figured it was better than returning a keyboard that I really liked.

Rod B.;Best lighting out there, but switches are soldered and it's IP20;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Blue – Tactile & Clicky;Verified Purchase;July 13, 2023;United States;"
This keyboard lights up like none other. That's the upside. The flip side is that it's due to SteelSeries proprietary switches, which can't be removed or hot-swapped. This becomes a real hassle when you need to clean the PCB, because there's no way to clean the top without desoldering and resoldering all the switches. That's pretty much a nightmare scenario, and you'll eventually end up with a dead keyboard.How is it possible that SteelSeries doesn't have any waterproofing on their PCB? It's not even IP30, which is just a very light coat that's not really rated for splashes at all, it's straight IP20, which exposes all the circuit board components to whatever you might spill on it. If you get this keyboard, just be aware that looks can be deceiving.Who doesn't have a cold drink by their side when they're using the computer? There are tons of better options, and even a several year-old GMMK 1 that'll run you a third of the price has hasic IP30/IP32. I've never had it glitch on me for years, and took it for granted that all keyboards are made the same. They're not.

Ok so. If you're used to red switches. Thats fine. But if you are not. Definitely get the brown switches. Its so easy to accidentally actuate red switches when you are typing which causes you to make alot of errors. I used browns for 10 years and, i like these. But I have to retrain my hands to really be more careful when typing since accidental actuation happens to me literally all the time on this thing.Im not sure if maybe I got a defect or not. When I just typed the word all, it put in 4 L's. Its been perfect when I have tested it on typeracer, and also keyboard tester websites. I dont know yet but, these red switches are super super responsive. You barely have to push them. I think its far to sensitive and mushy for anything outside of gaming for comfortable use.If I could switch it out for brown switches I would. But the brown switches on this keyboard was not a prime day deal. And this one was 50 bucks off so. Im pretty much stuck with it.

Adam Cohen;Little to No Support, Constantly Malfunctioning;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown – Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;April 21, 2020;United States;"
I really wanted to love this keyboard. It checked all the boxes I wanted: A TKL keyboard, a pass-through USB (which, annoyingly in this age of USB 3.0's massive throughput, still requires two USB ports, though this could be to avoid driver issues), RGB lighting, and a little screen.I was really let down though, because within a couple weeks the keys were malfunctioning. The right arrow key doesn't register all the time. If I give it a really heavy press, maybe it'll register, or it double clicks, or it just ignores me for a couple seconds. The W key is now starting to do the same. As a programmer, I use my right arrow key often, and would like it to work every time I push it. As a regular computer user, I'd really like to have a W key that works too.The above is enough to put me off it and pack it away as a lost cause, since sending things back in the time of COVID is not easy. Lesson learned to not buy from SteelSeries.But hey! Maybe you weren't put off by malfunctioning keys, or want to roll the dice and bet your product will be better than mine. Dear reader, let me put you off ever more.The screen is very half-baked. Aside from being able to display some pre-made .gifs, the screen otherwise has little to no utility. It is coplanar with the deck of the keyboard, so is largely outside your sight line depending on where you sit and your desk/chair height. If it were inclined slightly, you would be able to register it better. Equally oddly, there are next to no pre-built functions for it. There are some weird indie games, a Tidal (the music service nobody uses?), Discord, and a couple other apps, but here are some thing it can't do out of the box:1) Show you CPU usage like the old Logitech G132) Show you what song is currently playing on Spotify or any other music service3) Indicate the volume when you use the volume wheel4) Display the system timeIt literally, without downloading a third-party app by a random guy, can't serve as a clock. Also, when Logitech, Saitek, and Razer were putting touchscreens in everything 7 years ago, including an OLED screen that isn't full-color is inexcusable. The screen on my Swiftpoint Z is better than this.For all the power of the SteelSeries Engine (you can do literally almost anything with these RGB key customization options, including make a little Pac Man chasing ghosts across your keyboard as your day to day backlighting), it is wildly lacking when it comes to reprogramming this keyboard. Let's say you're like me, and your audio is controlled on an auxiliary interface. I'd like to rebind that audio wheel to ""skip song"", as there are no dedicated media keys. Well, too bad chief, you can't do that. The volume wheel and the play-pause button are just those, may they never be anything else. In a $130 keyboard (and I assume the same for $180) with 5 separate per-key parameters for RGB, including a PER KEY option that changes colors based on period of inactivity, I can't rebind the play-pause button?I could write a whole paragraph on the macro system, but I'd lose your attention.TL;DR It feels like this keyboard has so much it could be, and just doesn't deliver. The screen could be cool, but it is instead just one more piece of flair like your RGB scheme. The keys are comfortable, but don't always work. There are baffling choices in what can and can't be rebound. Everything that would make this keyboard fantastic is instead a hurdle you must overcome to enjoy it.

The so-called ""OLED"" display is really a dot matrix, grayscale image that is very limited on what it can display. So with that in mind, the system monitor is cool but this tiny display is so small that its keys actually block being able to read it in the first place.  AND if you choose the system monitor option Windows will prompt you for a click each time you boot up.  The marginally useful ""display"" space could have been used for more finger-friendly media controls including a larger volume control wheel and mute button.  The display is more a gimmick than anything else.To be fair I do like the illuminated USB port and the cable management.  But that doesn't make up for its shortfalls.

I bought this keyboard for work. I'm a programmer and try to invest in the tools I use every day for hours on end. I really liked the look and feel of this keyboard, but it died in just under 2 years. The X and P keys have started to die for some reason. They either don't type anything or double type the letter. I looked into replacing these switches, but the board doesn't seem very accessible for that.Overall for a mechanical keyboard, even one used heavily, I would've expected more life. I bought this keyboard in March 2021 to replace a corsair k70 that I'd been using for 6 years at work. I only replaced it because I wanted a TKL keyboard and the RGB was nice. Now I'm back to that K70, I guess.

I bought the apex 7 tkl in October 2020 and it started to malfunction in February 2022. I really like the keyboard itself and the software that goes with it. Unfortunately it started producing keyboard chatter a couple of months ago (double typing on a single press) and also not detecting a key press. I even tried removing the key caps and blowing compressed air, but that didn’t seem to work. I think I might’ve gotten unlucky and received a keyboard that wasn’t as durable as the average apex 7 tkl, since most reviews are so positive, but that just goes to show their poor quality control. Lastly, it’s a bummer that the warranty only lasts a year, because I just crossed that window a few months ago.I have upgraded to the apex pro because I really like the OLED screen and steel series engine, but let’s see how long that one lasts.

When the description states:  ""Tactile and Clicky"" keys, ""blue switch"" I kind of expect that.  The keys were very smooth however; they were very quite as well.  If you depressed the keys enough the keycap would contact the top of the keyboard case and make a ""Click"" like sound.  It was not coming from the key switches but the physical contact of keycap to face plate.  The OCD screen is neat, even it not used much.  The RGB was very good and easy to set up.  I expected a little more from Steel Series high end.  Did not get it, so the keyboard was returned.  I end up getting a ROOCAT VALCUN 121 that is truly amazing.

Tadvana Canakapalli;Decent keyboard, but not for everyone;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown – Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;February 28, 2021;United States;"
Reviewing the Apex 7 TKL version with the Brown switchesThis keyboard was overall decent, and has an action that is very close, if not indistinguishable from standard cherry mx brown switches. It is a pretty solid keyboard, and has a good overall build. I unfortunately had to return it due to the ergonomics of the keyboard. The lowest amount of tilt is much too raised and is not ergonomic. I have to prop up the front of the keyboard in order to get a flat enough layout to be able to keep my wrists flat, and I do not understand why keyboard manufacturers are so adamant about having their keyboards raised as such.I purchased this keyboard as I wanted to move away from my current full sized keyboard and go to a tkl keyboard to save on desk space. The design and footprint of this keyboard is great, but again, I could not get past the tilt of the keyboard, which my current Logitech G910 Orion keyboard does a much better job of (the function keys are barely raised above the spacebar).

Update: I've given up on this product, and I've written of SteelSeries. I plug in my older Corsair and have 0 issues. No matter how fast the USB hub connection is, it will NOT work. Plain and simple. I have all USB 3.0 hardware, but I even tried a USB 3.0 type B to make sure I had enough ""speed"" to suffice this, and nope, it just crashes. Constantly. Once it crashes, there is NOTHING you can do except unplug it. What an utterly useless product. I literally re-wired my whole set up to try to get it to work. This product will only work if you go directly into your PC, but honestly, I wouldn't even recommend it with that level of shoddy workmanship. Go with a different brand.Original Review - 2 Stars:I've never seen a keyboard crash before. I've been using keyboards through this USB switch for years. The moment this guy gets plugged into my switch, which is used to toggle between my work and home PC, it starts to randomly crash. I don't know if it's the screen that makes this different or what, but I've seen other people with this same issue on forums and Reddit. The keyboard becomes unresponsive and won't get better until you unplug and plug it back in again. It's a shame, I really like this keyboard otherwise... I have to find a replacement now, and it won't be SteelSeries anymore. I'm going back to my Corsair keyboards.

UPDATE: After trying to get support from Steelseries, they (SteelSeries, NOT Amazon)  wanted videos of the broken key, documentation, photos and stated that I would get an RMA.

Going back to a different manufacturer that supports their own products and doesn't treat the customer as the problem.I have no idea how this has such a high score.The first one I got had trouble with the Question Mark key.

Been using it for an year now. Bought the brown switches variantPros:1) Build quality is good, feels good, keycaps and keys are sturdy2) Lighting is bright! The ease to configure them is amazing3) The media controls is a good feature. I especially love the metal roller for adjusting volume.4) USB passthrough is very useful.Cons:1) Brown keys are not as tactile as I want them to be. They are less tactile compared to cherry MX browns. Actuation force is small enough for me to inadvertently use wrong keystrokes.2) One of keys sometimes presses twice. I did not expect it to start failing so soon. It's not often but seems like it will last just a few more months.3) Keyboard is loud if you are a heavy handed ttyper. Consider getting a switch dampener, otherwise the noise made is loud.4) The wrist rest is not really comfortable. There are better ones out there.

When I first got this keyboard, I absolutely loved it. It's very nice-looking and bright, and there's a million ways you can customize the coloring and lighting. The key presses also felt very smooth and typing on it was a real joy.Unfortunately, after about 5-6 months of use, I started having problems with multiple keys. It started with my Ctrl and Shift keys not registering all the time, which is very frustrating when you try to Ctrl-s to save something and end up with 's' characters in your document or code. Now I have several letter keys that do not always register, and my 'r' and 'u' key are now chattering/double-tapping. This has become a massive productivity-killer, as I have to correct almost every third or fourth word that I type.I have tried a full factory reset and re-installation of the keyboard's software, and have tried pulling up the keycaps of individual keys and pulling junk out and air-dusting around the switches, and nothing has worked. I really wanted to like this keyboard, but this has become extremely frustrating. I would expect better quality and/or durability from a $100 + keyboard.

Quick to the point, the key layout is to close in space, more like a laptop keyboard.  The biggest issue I had was not having an Fn key on the keyboard.  Instead, there are two Windows keys on each side of the space bar.  I reached out to customer support via email and they stated there is no way to customer program the key default (I was trying to program the right side windows key to work as a function key).  I was able to find a work around by plugging in a separate keyboard and using that to customer program the key function with the software.  But I still ended up returning the keyboard.  The biggest issue is the close proximity of the keys.  Trying to use the keyboard for work during the day and gaming at night proved not to be a good combination.  If you have smaller hands, the keyboard could work for you.

I've owned this keyboard for a little over a year. I've done maintenance almost 1-2 times a month to keep this keyboard as pristine as possible. Less than 6 months in, I experienced my first key chattering issue. it wasn't a big deal back then due to the fact that it was only happening on my ""i"" key but nonetheless, it was quite annoying to deal with. Slowly over the course of the last 3-4 months, the chattering issue spread from being only my ""i"" key to now infecting my k, v, h, m, d and w. Multiple inputs are registered per keystroke which rendered the keyboard basically useless to me.  I created a customer support ticket and had to wait almost 3-4 weeks before I received my initial response. After back and forths for almost an additional month (keep in mind we are now 2 months into the support ticket) they finally offered me a solution. BREAK my current keyboard and send in 20 pictures to prove it was done so they can continue with an RMA, effectively rendering me USELESS for 3 weeks before my keyboard was shipped and delivered, or place a $180 HOLD ON MY BANK ACCOUNT while they shipped out a new keyboard and I was still expected to go through the process of breaking my obviously defected keyboard before they released the hold. This is absolutely malicious and criminal activity from steelseries. I'm BEYOND angry and I would recommend everyone who sat here and read through this to NEVER PURCHASE A STEELSERIES PRODUCT.

First I noticed was the Firmware kept crashing, so I did what Steele Series recommend and reverted the Firmware. After a month each key required different pressures to activate them, then later on I noticed that some keys, the most used one, required a further key press than others and frequently would not activated until bottoms out. Because of this, some keys that active higher on the stroke repeat while typing. Finally, the deal breaker, the scroll wheel to cycle the menu. It broke completely. For the premium Price, a keyboard so inconsistent, and one that does NOT have a Print Screen, Scroll Lock or many other keys should be sold for half of what they are retailing it for. Don't bother with this keyboard, Try Razer. I had no luck with the poor quality of Logitech Gaming keyboards as well.---------------------------------------------------Update 01March2022Steel Series can not warranty the keyboard, they have no stock in more than 90 days. The TKL is also not available anywhere online. I would stay away from the Keyboards as I am thinking they are not going to sell them anymore. 120 days with zero stock in their warehouses is a telling sign of impending bankruptcy.

I got this keyboard 3 months ago and was happy from day one. I love the size, the looks, the feel. Everything was great. But today I noticed the LED for the S key was a bit off white while all the others were white. Several hours later and it has gotten progressively worse. It is now a very pale yellow which tells me the blue diode is fading. Its really quite disappointing considering the price of the keyboard. I have some replacement leds on the way so I am hoping I can do the repair. The necessary leds aren't extremely easy to come by and I was only able to find common anode at a reasonable price and shipping time. Hopefully common anode is the correct pin out.

The keyboard is absolutely riddled with problems. These weren’t user inflicted problems either. I made the switch to PC recently and unfortunately couldn’t find the time to practice using mouse and keyboard; so I stuck with controller as I mostly play COD and OW. So the most action the keyboard saw was light typing for essays. The issues it had were some of my keys would type random letters and activate the tab key; so trying to write an essay was frustrating when you needed to use a quotation mark and instead it would indent your paragraph and type a whole bunch of letters. As pictured above though it looks like I just typed random letters, this is literally what spews our whenever I press my colon, quotation and question mark keys. Also the rubberized stoppers on the keyboard that keep it from moving on surfaces, fall off very easily. The scroll wheel was very fragile and would constantly remain pressed in, which mutes your audio and you can’t unmute it from windows since it prioritizes the keyboard first. Their customer support was very unhelpful as they gave the stereotypical simple solutions to your problem. So it would take about several responses before they finally worked through the whole list of common solutions to customer problems and ask specific questions about your problem. These issues are not present at first and mine arose just after the Amazon return date was expired, so I can’t even return it. I would suppress my excitement for its looks and look for a more reliable option.

What a bummer, I used to really like Steelseries but I just can't recommend them anymore. It seems they have very little grasp on quality control. This keyboard is so aesthetically pleasing, but other than that it's nothing special. My issue is that the quality per switch ( I have the reds) doesn't feel consistent. I haven't even had this keyboard for more than a month and a couple switches have noticeably more resistance, and are also giving off a grinding like sound. Too bad Steelseries, lost a loyal consumer today, not to mention customer support is an absolute joke. If you plan on spending this much on a mechanical keyboard I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

People mentioned here that some keys stopped working or acting weird. That happened to me in less then a year of usage. I've got 2 keys ""y"" and ""z"" half working. Cleaning it didn't help, so I contacted SteelSeeries customer service and got replacement. And after couple of month same happened to the new one, but now with different key ""3"". I really like its ergonomic and customization, but quality for the price is very disappointing.

So this is my first SteelSeries keyboard I have ever bought, and I have owned probably 20 different ones. I like it, it is overpriced for what it is. It doesnt use Cherry MX switches it uses SteelSeries own brand of mechanical switches which honestly I didnt care for too much. They didnt feel like browns at all, it barely had a bump. I returned this but it was decent to use. I like Cherry switches too much so ill stick with those.

After less than a year, letter V stopped emitting blue color, and keyboard started acting strange, turning on/off intermittently when using in-browser applications. Now I don't think I can RMA it anymore. I really wanted to love Steelseries but the only thing I have from them that still works is a mousepad... :(

I have 10 year old keyboards with displays that can give me the fps of whatever I am playing, a 130 dollar MODERN keyboard with an oled should be able to so do too. Hey, it's not like a lot of people use AMD right?  I'm not interested in doing SteelSeries troubleshooting for them.  Beautiful keyboard, what a shame.  EDIT: Everything else works fine and it feels wonderful so I'm keeping it and adding a star, I would be happy to change my review once they solve this problem.  I just wanted my fellow AMD users to have a heads up.

David Berthelot;Not durable but good looking keyboard;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown – Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;April 14, 2021;United States;"
I bought this keyboard 5 months ago because I like its look and feel.After 5 months of daily use (mostly programming and web browsing,  nothing intense), the spacebar switch is acting erratically (sometimes  it writes 2 spaces, sometimes 1, sometimes 0). I tried to clean it up, to turn the keyboard upside down and tap it on the  back. Nothing fixes the issue.The model I own has brown switches.Had it been 2 years,  I would put more stars, but to start failing after only 5 months seems unacceptable.

Doug;Warranty is non-existent;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown – Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;October 10, 2021;United States;"
After less than a year of usage, the volume wheel stopped working. Contacted Steelseries and after doing some troubleshooting, they agreed the volume wheel was bad. They agreed to exchange the keyboard but alas this is where the gotcha is: they don't send you a new keyboard, they instead give you a code you can use on their website to order the same keyboard again. Problem is, this keyboard has been out of stock for over a year!! So now I'm stuck with a broken volume wheel and a code they provided to order a new keyboard that has now expired because they don't seem to stock this keyboard on their website anymore. Contacted them about this and have gotten no response. Seems like they're sending stock to dealers such as Amazon and others but not putting any inventory on their website which renders their ""warranty"" useless.

Initially I was really happy with the product, feels great, with the software it's good to configure the keyboard.However after a fairly short usage (I am a very casual gamer) I was surprised to find that the rubber pads that are supposed to enhance the grip of the keyboard on a desk started coming loose. I am really disappointed that a company like SteelSeries has a problem like that. I've got a mouse from them and there the rubber pads started coming off as well.

Keyboard began to fail after 1 year, but I was uncertain if the keyboard, USB hub or cable was the cause.  I had to unplug and replug the USB cable to restart the keyboard when it would stop responding.  Finally, after 2 years, I replaced the USB hub to troubleshoot since the keyboard stopped working entirely, but the issue was identical regardless of the USB hub.  Ordered another brand as a replacement.  Will not buy another SteelSeries again.

The only good - Great tactile feel, 10/10.The bad- omg.. so many things!1. Bad quality of the keyboard. The magnet from the wrist rest detached and stuck itself to the keyboard body on the very first use. The USB port provided on the keyboard is sharp enough to give give you a cut.2. Mediocre screen quality of the onboard display. Something that you won't expect in a $130 range.3. The USB cable is super thick and uses 2 USB ports taking away the portability aspect of the TKL Keyboard.4. The wrist rest is a huge dust magnet.

I don't know why people like this model and brand so much. The so-called ""quiet"" red keys are much louder than my other blue-key keyboard by Roccat. The keys on this SteelSeries are very loose to the touch, and longer keys such as ""Shift"" bend and twist during rapid typing. The worst aspect though, is the Spacebar. It makes a loud thunk every time you hit it. It's audible throughout the house, and sounds like the keyboard is designed to amplify it like a passive woofer. Probably just the low-quality materials, which feel cheap to the touch. Instead of SteelSeries, I recommend Roccat and Corsair brands.

This keyboard is falsely advertised as having ""quiet"" mechanical keys. Although they don't click which makes it not feel mechanical at all, the keys are louder than my previous keyboard with clicking keys. So this keyboard feels crappy, and isn't even quiet. Double negative. I don't even think this keyboard qualifies as mechanical. I would not waste your money on this.

Omg.. I got the brown switches and you can't feel the tactile bump. They don't feel much better than membrane keys. They are NOT cherry keys and they should have passed the money they saved onto the customer. For $80 and if you like mushy keys it might be worth it. The k70 is sub $100 these days with a choise of switches if you have the desk space.

This is a solid keyboard physically, I have no complaints about the overall build quality of this keyboard but the steel series operating system is below average at best. Every time I restart my computer steel series hijacks all my default audio settings and changes it to the keyboard.

If you use AMD CPUs or GPUs the ""System Monitor"" app in the Steelseries engine WILL NOT WORK for you. When I saw that I could  display temps on the little oled screen, I bought the keyboard. To my surprise this feature was broken and unusable to all AMD users. This is a known issue and Steelseries seems like they're doing nothing about it. Other than this, the keyboard is generally good. The keyboard works just fine, and the other features still work on it after a year of heavy use. It's just disappointing that the one selling point I was attracted to is unavailable to me only because I built my PC using AMD parts...  STEELSERIES FIX YOUR PROGRAM SO EVERYONE CAN USE IT.

Tou Cheng;Gateron Browns are NASTY! But board is decent...;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Red – Linear & Quiet;;May 27, 2020;United States;"
I did not like this board in Gateron Brown switches. I gave it 3 months to get used to... but I did not enjoy it, then sold it off to someone on fb market. Here is my opinion, from a keyboard enthusiast to fellow consumers.Cons——1. Terrible stabilizers and lots of key wobbles: I wanted to love this board, but the rattling of the keys just made me feel so uncomfortable. Never felt like I had a firm key to put my fingers on. This caused me to never feel confident that I’m on the right keys. Average 115 wpm turned to 100wpm with this board. I experience sooooo many typos on this board, which I usually never do on any other boards. I even swapped the keycaps with hyperx pudding keycaps, but doesn’t feel good.2. Tactile feedback: My favorite keyswitches would have a tactile feedback, but this was just awful. It felt like... ants crawling on my knuckles? That’s what I can describe. True tactility cannot be found from gateron browns from what I have experienced with this apex 7 tkl. The tactility from the Roccat Vulcan Aimo is better, but they don’t have a tkl version.3. Non-detachable usb cable?????? I respect the cable routing, but I think a detachable usb cable isn’t too much to ask for.4. Aluminum board... but: there’s so much “Ping” sounds when I press keys in certain areas. I noticed it right when I unboxed it. I kept tapping it on a desk mat and constant “ting ting” sounds. I ignored it but 3 months in and I still felt annoyed by it. My ears would be buzzing.5. NO PRINT SCREEN BUTTON: I didn’t realize I would need it so much. I thought they’d have a secondary function for it, but they don’t! You have to use snippet with shortcut keys like ctrl+alt+S or something, however snippet tool doesn’t have some features that I wanted to use as print screen had. Print Screen would help me a lot with programming when I work from home. But this Board is focused on gamers so that’s fine.Pros——1. Usb Passthrough is nice to have. Although if I traveled with my tkl keyboard... I dislike having the extra usb-passthrough cable swinging all over the place when I setup in a new location.2. Oled screen: it looks cool.3. Aesthetic is amazing. The lights are bright, and it doesn’t have such a gamer vibe. It’s my ideal keyboard style.Conclusion—————I’ve tried this board in red switches, and gateron reds seem to be one of their superior switch. They (gateron) doesn’t really specialize in tactility it seems. I’d suggest focusing on gateron reds or gateron omniswitches if you plan on getting this board. It’s smoother than cherries. Browns feel like crunchy sand, not tactile. For 129.99$, you can probably get a better keyboard like a Ducky One2 TKL on mechanicalkeyboards dot com. They have great stabilizers and cherry clears. Typing this on my new Ducky One2 SF w/cherry reds.
