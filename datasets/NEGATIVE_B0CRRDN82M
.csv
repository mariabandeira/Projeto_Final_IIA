Debbie Williams;Disappointed;0;Verified Purchase;April 15, 2024;United States;"
Had such high hopes. The price was good, nice color, lightweight and easy to assemble. But, it would not stay on longer than 15 seconds at a time. I corresponded back and forth with Jagrom customer support trying to resolve the problem. Everything they suggested was already clearly stated in the instructions, which I had  read thoroughly before beginning use. Maybe I just got a dud. I've never returned anything to Amazon, never needed to. I am returning this trimmer.

Amazon Customer;It's gets the job done, but...;0;Verified Purchase;April 7, 2024;United States;"
This is a nice trimmer. It's lightweight and I love the fact that it's cordless. My only issue is you have to hold down 2 triggers in order for it to run continuously. There is a trigger for your hand and also a small thumb trigger. If you let go of the thumb trigger it will turn off. This is extremely annoying as it puts a strain on your thumb after a while. I had to improvis and tie a string around the small trigger so that I didnt have to hold it the whole time. Other than that, it's good and it got the job done. I have a small yard so I used it for the whole yard. If you you are using it just to trim your edges I suppose holding 2 triggers wouldn't be a big deal, but if you are using this to cut your yard in place of a lawnmower I recommend trying a different trimmer.

Debra Pumphrey;Spool is hard to remove;0;Verified Purchase;April 27, 2024;United States;"
It's very lightweight, batteries are great, but....removing the spool is hard to do, string gets caught on spacer guard when it's the proper length for cutting.

Acoustic Technology;You've got to be kidding.;0;Verified Purchase;April 20, 2024;United States;"
Extremely flimsy, especially when used as an edger. The motor wobbles with the wheel, leaving a crooked, jagged path. The safety guard gets in the way of edging all the way through the grass. It is not a true 90 degree angle when pivoted, more like 80, which means you have to hold it at an angle for a straight cut. Unless you are under 5-1/2 feet you will have to bend over to use it. Your hand will be very sore from trying to hold the safety button.

If you are just doing basic grass for edging it works ok but for heavy duty weed whacking not so good will bog down in a hurry.

Charity Hagen;Poorly made and difficult to use;0;Verified Purchase;March 18, 2024;United States;"
This weed eater is just awful.  To operate it you have to push a button in and squeeze the trigger.  Almost impossible to do without getting sore in the hand very quickly.  When I released the trigger the weed eater did not quit right away, it kept spinning, and sometimes I had to squeeze the trigger twice to get it to stop.  Not sure if thatâ€™s normal or a defect in my unit.  Also very underpowered.  Cut through flimsy weeds ok but had trouble with grass.  Also my back got very sore using it.  The way the handle is mounted did not conform to my body very well.  I would not waste my money on this unit.

lightningbug;Weak as a kitten;0;Verified Purchase;May 4, 2024;United States;"
My JAGROM 12-inch Cordless String Trimmer is so weak that it bogs down as soon as it touches grass, and it is not even strong enough to trim the string when it does the auto feed. If you stand real still and be patient, it will trim some of the grass, but you better hope the string dont break. Severely disappointed, especially for the price.

AVOID THIS THING!!! I charged one battery all night and the other all day, and I know they are fully charged. You have to hold the trigger down the entire time and it will only run for about 5 seconds at a time, then you must release the trigger and then reengage it..over and over. The spool WILL NOT ADVANCE. What a disappointment. You'd be better off going outside and chewing the weeds with your teeth. This chunk of junk is going back.

For about 30 minutes it worked fine. Then I noticed the trim string was not auto advancing. I opened the spool housing and a tiny spring was loose inside . I have no idea where it came from or where it was supposed to be. I packaged it up and returned it .
