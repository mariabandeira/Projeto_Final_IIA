Fabian M.;Probably better to buy at your local market;0;Verified Purchase;March 20, 2024;United States;"
First purchased these at my local Walmart to try out and absolutely loved them! From my personal experience, the top biscuits seemed more on the stale/dry side since the Nutella filling was dry. But once reaching the bottom half, the Nutella was more creamy/rich. Could eat like an Oreo cookie in a way - by splitting it apart and enjoying the various layers. If you‚Äôre craving to try these - don‚Äôt hesitate!Only feedback would go towards Amazon itself as the cookies are not bad in flavor. Unfortunately due to its packaging, majority of my biscuits came crushed and smashed - kind of killing the way nice size and design of the biscuit itself. Another thing I would add in is the lack of freshness (best before 09/06/24). Throughout the whole bag, the Nutella filling looks super dry and just not very appealing. When eating the crushed biscuit with dry Nutella, it was pretty sad to eat - definitely not the same experience as my first bag. The price is great if you subscribe, but i might just go back to my local stores if it means spending a few cents more for freshness and whole biscuits.

Cindi Clinton;I don't care for these, but you might;0;Verified Purchase;April 29, 2024;United States;"
I wasn't expecting these to be so hard. I mean, I know it says biscuit which implies crunchiness, I was just expecting a different crunch. These are hard on the outside & filled with Nutella, so when you take a bite it just crumbles. Additionally, the sweet of the biscuit & the sweet of the Nutella aren't very good together. The taste was cloying. I just expected something that held together better & was nicer to eat. I won't buy these again. My idea of them was better than the reality of them, sadly.If you're into over-the-top sweetness, you'll love these & I wish I could give you mine :D

Linus Eks;Not the freshest;0;Verified Purchase;April 13, 2024;United States;"
I absolutely love these biscuits, and I usually get them at the dollar general near my house, however,  most of the time they are out of stock, and I‚Äôve yet to find them at any other store.. so, I tried getting them here on Amazon, but compared to the ones I get at dollar general, these seem a little old.  They‚Äôre still delicious, but there‚Äôs  a noticeable difference in freshness.  The Nutella isn‚Äôt as creamy and the biscuits are not as crispy.

The Nutella Biscuits are awesome; have ordered them several times. The dissatisfaction is not with the product.  It is with the shipping by the vendor. The last couple if times, the biscuits were mostly broken with the Nutella filling spread over the broken pieces of cookies. What a mess; sprinkle on ice cream.  üòâ

I believe this was a failure to create biscuits. Too sweet n the dough used to create the biscuit was poor quality. I am use to European biscuits. So these were not for me. Improve the quality of flour or dough to make em tasteful. Thanks

This is my second time ordering and the first order didn‚Äôt come all crushed and melted. I ordered 2 8 packs of canned water and they packed them together. Makes no sense. They are amazing but I will get from the store near me as Walmart, Target and most grocery stores carry them. I was disappointed in the way they packaged it. Again other then that they are very addictive

Cookies arrived all crumbled up on a box with heavy items, so they started off in a bad place.I don't know why, but I did not enjoy these cookies. The first one tasted great, but they seemed to lose their flavor.If you are not a die-hard hazelnut fan, maybe consider another cookie.

These taste very good but were sent in just a semi- padded envelope and every cookie was broken/ cracked when they arrived.

Charles;Bland flavor and very crumbly;0;Verified Purchase;March 23, 2024;United States;"
The filling in these doesn't taste like Nutella. The flavor is bland.It may be that the cookie they use masks the Nutella flavor. If the filling is really identical to the Nutella sold in jars, then they need to improve the cookie recipe. Or maybe they need to improve the ratio of Nutella to cookie.They are also a mess to eat. The cookies are very crumbly and there is no way to take a bite without being showered in crumbs. It's much worse than other crisp cookies.These are simply not worth the cost of almost 25 cents for each cookie in the bag.

These are good but I found out the hard way that the lecithin that they use as an emulsifier is soy lecithin because I had a bad reaction to it. If you don't want to list that you're using soy, find something else to use. I'm giving one star for trying to conceal the fact that you're using soy and that's not fair to the customer. Will not buy again!
