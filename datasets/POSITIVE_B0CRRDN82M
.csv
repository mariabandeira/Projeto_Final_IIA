Amazon Customer;Simple, easy to use trimmer that does the job ...;0;Verified Purchase;April 1, 2024;United States;"
The trimmer is light weight, and easy to manage, even by a child or small adult. The design includes two adjustment mechanisms for the angle of the head and handle, to accommodate pretty much any body type - without using any tools. Just ""click"" and change! The entire shaft also rotates to turn the trimmer into an edger, if you want to use it like that. Although it works fine for regular grass, and very thin woody stems, you might like to get a more powerful ""commercial"" unit if you expect more. The two batteries are a nice touch - this feature allows you to work continuously, because you can quickly charge one while the other is being used. They batteries charge VERY fast! It is also nice that several spools of pre-wound line are included, so you will have plenty of line for months of use - without ever having to buy any line for refills. Initial assembly was quite simple, and I only had to look up one part, to see how it fit together with the rest. Ready to go in 5-10 minutes. Uncomplicated. I like it!

Odious Yak;Great weed wacker/trimmer. I would purchase again!;0;Verified Purchase;March 23, 2024;United States;"
Initially skeptical about replacing my gas-powered edger with this weed wacker, but I was quickly converted by its exceptional performance. Its lightweight design and maneuverable/rotatable head make trimming and edging around my garden/driveway a fairly effortless task. The intuitive controls and automatic line feed function make it very easy to use.The battery life is actually great. One charge allows me two full cuts and then some, definitely surpassing my expectations, essentially rendering my gas-powered edger obsolete. This is a bit quieter than expected as well. You still hear the weeds and grass being cut, but it's nice not to deal with the loud gas trimmer.Overall, it's very efficient and highly effective for maintaining my yard. I would absolutely purchase it again.Update: just trimmed down an over grown garden and edged something that I thought was doomed. This thing is great.

Venkateswaran;Efficient and versatile;0;Verified Purchase;March 20, 2024;United States;"
This cordless trimmer is fantastic! It's quick to charge, has a sleek design, and arrived promptly. Not only is it a trimmer, but it also effortlessly transitions into an edger with a simple head rotation. The addition of a wheel facilitates smooth switching between trimming and edging, while the spacer guard protects plants and landscaping. With two lithium-ion batteries and a fast charger, I get 60 minutes of uninterrupted work time, ample for all my yard tasks. Its ergonomic design, including adjustable cutting head and handle, ensures comfort and control. Maneuvering around tight spots and edges is a breeze thanks to its features.

Aaron C;Great Trimmer - cool edging wheel;0;Verified Purchase;March 29, 2024;United States;"
Sweet trimmer! It comes with two batteries and charger. Super quick setup, took me just a couple minutes to have it all ready to go. I actually would skip putting the metal guard on the front of it - it prevents me from being able to get right up where my grass meets some landscaping rocks that I have.As far as trimming ability, it trims just fine - better than one I had for many years that I bought at a box store. My favorite feature is the rolling wheel for eding along the curb - you use that and can also adjust the head so it's the right position to trip while still holding it upright. Works great!! I didn't blow away the dust/debris yet with my blower, but the line is very clean.

AmazonToast;A great weed whacker for your lawn arsenal;0;Verified Purchase;March 29, 2024;United States;"
This string trimmer has been a great addition to my bag of tricks as spring kicks into full gear. I have always been a gas weed whacker kind of guy but after the third season in a row of refusing to start, despite having done all the maintenance on it last fall for storage, I was fed up. Time to go electric. This string trimmer spoke to me for 2 reasons: One was the two batteries that come by default. Lots of companies send one or even 0 batteries with their devices and wouldn't you know that they are the same price as the actual tool! Two batteries is an absolute must for gardening applications because if it dies on you half way through you know you have the other one on the charger ready to go.The second thing is the second retaining clip. This seems like a bit of an odd thing to point out but having used string trimmers for my whole life I can tell you that retaining clip, the part that holds your reel of string in place sees a lot of abuse. The clips hit rocks, metal pipes, get bumped or dropped etc. Once they break they can be hard to find replacements. This product comes with an extra one which I think shows how much thought they put into this product. Good call.Assembly was easy, no tools are required to get up and running. A reel of string comes pre-installed which is a nice touch and a handy length guide for the string is right on the guard. You will not find better battery life for this price point; but with the dual batteries I think that is a non-issue. I posted a picture of all the extras that this product comes with because quite honestly this product comes with everything you need to start whacking with lots of reels for backup. I'm pretty sure there is enough line here to mow my 3 acres outright, but I'll leave that experiment for a different review.

Yerocasil;Lightweight, light to medium duty residential trimmer;0;Verified Purchase;May 3, 2024;United States;"
I've really enjoyed this versatile and lightweight trimmer so far.  It was very easy to assemble and it's a breeze to adjust.  I didn't end up installing the metal edge guard, as I like to turn the trimmer sideways to edge the driveway and sidewalks.  The roller on the edge makes this job less stressful on the back (see image).  I appreciated that 2 batteries were included, as well as 6 preloaded string spools and an extra spool cap.  As some other reviewers mentioned, this is a residential trimmer, intended for light to medium work.  It isn't going to topple small saplings or anything.  However, I prefer it to my larger trimmer for the majority of my yardwork as it is much kinder to my back!

Kathy E.;So far so good;0;Verified Purchase;May 4, 2024;United States;"
I’m a little concerned about longevity with this weed eater. It seems a bit flimsy. I will not try to use it in really weedy, tall grass situations. Will pull out the big guys for that. This one is perfectly fine for everyday trimming around bushes, fence posts, patios, sidewalks though. I have used it for some simple edging where it’s been edged previously. It fulfills what I needed it for.

David Bergeron;Powerful, lightweight, and Ergonomic;0;Verified Purchase;April 1, 2024;United States;"
I recently purchased this after my gas powered trimmer died.  I was a bit skeptical about going to a battery operated trimmer, but I must say, I wish I switched sooner.  This trimmer is so much easier to handle.  The weighting of it is better than my old trimmer and it has plenty of power and battery life.  I have about 1/3 of an acre to maintain, trimming around the perimiter of my yard and house, and edging around the driveway and sidewalk.  I love how this trimmer rotates and has a wheel to make edging simple.  It used to be so much harder to edge with my gas trimmer, trying to hold it the right height and after a while, the weight became an issue.  With all the extra spools (8 of them), you won't have to worry about running out of string in the middle of doing your yard.  No more buying gas and mixing in oil.  I definitely recommend anyone in the market for a new trimmer to go battery powered and give this one a try.

Paul Frederick;This item is well built, well designed and works well.;0;Verified Purchase;March 29, 2024;United States;"
This works as well as my corded Black & Decker does. The charge lasts about a half hour and takes slightly longer to charge, so if both are charged when you start, you can switch one after a half hour and put the discharged one on the charger. By the time the second battery discharges, the first is almost charged up, so you get a 15 minute break after an hour's work. The string advances effortlessly and lasts pretty long. I haven't used it as an edger, but it seems like it would be handy for that. Someone mentioned that it is difficult to push in the button and hold the trigger, but once you have the trigger pulled, the button stays in, so I haven't noticed a problem with that. The handle is adjustable and I find it comfortable to use.

Benjamin Fugate;Works great as an edger!;0;Verified Purchase;March 28, 2024;United States;"
I got this overnight and decided to give it a shot today since my lawn was getting pretty long as we end March. The edges of my yard went 2-3 inches onto my driveway, and this thing sliced right through them. The little metal guard (which I honestly never put on my old weed wacker) was surprisingly helpful and kept me from destroying the line immediately. A single battery lasted the whole time for me, but it is nice that it came with a second in case somebody has an exceptionally large yard! Super impressed with this for the price.

I have had many trimmers over the last 40 years but this is the best value I have seen or owned ever. Well engineered structure and super easy to adjust for upright or flat trimming. The put together or set up took maybe 10 minutes with only two screws and I'm very slow. Batteries have a good life and charging set up is a simple plug in. The batteries alone are worth $40 each and you get two and a charger with the unit.Compared with other trimmers I've owned, this is a winner.

Terry;Good cordless trimmer;0;;March 24, 2024;United States;"
I got this because I needed a new trimmer and was looking for a cordless one and after reviewing, I thought I would give this one a try, and it has worked really good.  Some of the things that attracted me were the dual batteries provided, extra trimming spools, and the adjustability of the trimmer.  My old one would rotate 90 degrees but I could not adjust the angle of the trimmer head, I really like how this one allows you to rotate, adjust the angle, and even adjust the grip too.  Assembly was easy, and I like how you can break it back down for storage in months its not needed. Operation wise it has worked really good, the first time I used and did the entire yard it used up most of the first battery.  Had I needed to do more, having the additional battery was great, now it is trimmed though it quicker to maintain.  I checked after my initial use and there is still a significant amount of wire on the spool too, so with all the extra spools I won't need to get more for a long time most likely.  Unit trims easily and quickly and with the adjustments its comfortable to use and accurate. Extremely satisfied with it.

This lawn mower really works. I used to have my lawn mowed all the time, but now with this mower, I can do it myself. Both let me exercise and save me a lot of money! That's killing two birds with one stone. This lawnmower is very sharp. I used it to cut grass the other day and it cut off even thick branches with ease. The big lawn in front of my house will be taken care of with this mower. The weeding machine itself is light in weight, strong in power, and sharp in blade, so it is very convenient and labor-saving to use, and the weeding speed is very fast, which is several times more efficient than manual care. It's a good thing to work with. It's so good.
