I would think the spoon would have been a little bigger. The handle was fine. But the picture and words needed to be just a little bit larger. Otherwise it works.

Bought this for a gift for my daughters boyfriend. Paired with some gourmet PB, it was perfect. The spoon comes in a really nice box. The print is easy to read and it has a king handle for deep dipping!

This was a gift for someone in the family. It’s super cute and it was a little bit of a joking gift so it was perfect for the type of gift. It’s not engraved, so if you’re looking for something engraved this is not that. Over all cute!

Suzanne;Perfect for your mad tea party.;0;;April 17, 2024;United States;"
I ordered this A very Merry Unbirthday to You Engraved Stainless Steel Spoon because my family are all big Alice in Wonderland fans.We have been known to have the occasional Alice themed tea party, and I thought this spoon would be perfect for the next one. I haven’t decided yet whether to use this as a sugar spoon, or for lemonade.The sugar spoon is so much more tea party-ish, but this is bang, slender spoon. It would also work well for lemonade, which is always nice as an optional beverage at a tear party for those who don’t drink tea.The engraved images and words are clear and easy to read.The spoon came in a black presentation box with a small bow, suitable for gifting.This spoon is quite cute and well made. I might buy another one of their spoons—I like the Mary Poppins one, and the peanut butter and Mac and cheese spoons are a lot of fun.I’m a huge collector of children’s literature, especially vintage British children’s books. I love this kind of collectible. This is a great little Alice themed spoon for your next mad tea party.

Impickle;Such a cute idea;0;;March 20, 2024;United States;"
For the serious peanut butter lover :) You really must have your own jar of peanut butter to make this spoon really work for you - because who wants to scoop peanut butter out of a jar that this spoon has been double and triple, and quadruple dipped into lol? I'm just kidding (kind of). My guess is if you love peanut butter enough to buy a spoon dedicated to that purpose, there's a pretty good chance you do have your own jar. I think this is cute as can be - a great gift idea. I wish the edges felt a little bit smoother in my hand. But overall it feels sturdy and the length is great because you can reach all the way to the bottom of the jar.
