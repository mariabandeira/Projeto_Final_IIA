Kornbread;The box it comes in very cool;0;Verified Purchase;April 26, 2024;United States;"
It’s a little on the expensive side for a hat I would imagine that part of the price is the box it comes in!! Pretty cool better than most shoe boxes..Pretty cool hat and a ton of colors to pick from!!

One of the nest things I noticed right away is this comes with its own box it’s a specialty box with magnet inside, so you can protect the hat.  These are very expensive, but with the special box that comes with it the incredible design and stitching. It definitely makes it well worth it.  High-quality great design definitely an attention getter.

The brand is great. We love Capiche. Every hat we have purchased through Amazon the box and/or hat comes damaged and that really sucks. You need the box to protect the hat. This box came crushed. The hat was in good condition.

I really like this style!  It has a suede purple lip and under has grim reaper art. I was mainly looking for a purple hat because I really liked that color. Overall i'm super satisfied with it.

SomeDad;Above average quality.;0;Verified Purchase;September 25, 2023;United States;"
I bought the $25 one. I'm cheap and it's hard to spend $50 on a flatbrim cap. That said the quality was evident right away. I have lots of caps but the one stands out as being of higher quality than my other name brand caps. Get compliments and feel confident in it. Makes me  consider the $50 options available. The ""flat"" brim is ever so slightly curved (in a good way).
