InkSlime.;Such an amazing product.;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Red ‚Äì Linear & Quiet;Verified Purchase;July 4, 2023;United States;"
A very high quality product from steelseries. High quality and affordable. The keyboard Led back lighting is extremely bright and noticeable. Of course the led lighting can be dimmed. The customization of the keys are endless. The OLED screen is also very nice. Bright and highly customizable. The keys feel very nice, not too loud, very smooth, just all around amazing. The software (Steelseries GG) can be very clunky sometimes. But it is easy to use. Sometimes my custom illumination for my keys do not load up and I have to manually open up the software and select the content myself. Although a bit tedious at times but the keyboard doesn't just shut off. It defaults to one of their amazing/beautiful presets that it comes with. I highly recommend this product. Especially for people just getting into computers. I love this keyboard to death and would buy it over hundreds of times.

Very ergonomic thanks to the magnetic wrist rest, fun and clicky for typing, while being relatively quiet. Great customization options and cool volume control button. Seems high quality build.In my opinion, TKL are superior to mini or full sized keyboards.

Mazin Recine;Great Keyboard with Cool Features;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown ‚Äì Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;July 28, 2019;United States;"
I have owned a Steelseries keyboard in the past and was greatly disappointed with the switches it used. I had a m750 with the qx2 switches, and they just felt off to me. Not really sure how to explain, but they just felt off. Im not generally a fan of linear switches ( as a gamer, blasphemy I know) as I tend to have a heavy hand and accidentally hold shift  or ctrl by accident, which messes up my movement and gets me killed. Not only that but I feel I mess up more when typing essays for college and have to go back to revise more frequently. I needed a new keyboard that would allow more space for my mouse, as I play on a low dpi, and was looking at TKL models from various companies. Originally I was planning on the G Pro from Logitech to go with my G Pro Wireless, but then I realized they had Romer-G switches. I tested them out and found them alright, but lack of customization and after market keycaps was a turn off for me. The new Apex Pro TKL came out with their OmniPoint switches, which are linear switches that you could change the actuation point of to fit your preference. Again, I am not a fan of linear, so this disappointed me as the rest of the keyboard caught my attention. Luckily with the Apex 7 they allow you to choose your switches out of the 3 options they provide. I chose the browns as I wanted something fast but with some feedback. When it arrived 2 days later, I was impressed with the size and beauty of it. The nicest keyboard I owned so far. The switches feel nice, and there are a few features you won‚Äôt find on a some other TKL keyboards like the OLED display (mostly a gimmick but cool nonetheless), usb passthrough, cable routing, and dial. The magnetic wrist rest isn‚Äôt plush, more like a flat rubber surface to prop up your hand. That isn‚Äôt to say it‚Äôs not comfortable or soft, but it is a pain to clean as it is a dust magnet. They keycaps feel cheap and are my main gripe for a premium keyboard, however I Luckily had higher quality shine-through keycaps from previously. Overall I am satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing.

I'm in love with the keyboard: it's silent, well built, beautiful and quite customizable.Use this for gaming and gaming only, for productivity you really need the extra keys you're missing out and a membrane keyboard will do the job better.

This keyboard is great if you use it properly, you cannot use the Keyboard part of the cable through a USB hub. the keyboard will not function... at all... if you plug in the keyboard through a  USB hub it will not work. you may plug in the USB PASSTHROUGH through a USB hub but that's it. if you absolutely need to use it though a hub you need to have another keyboard to get into your computer with. the keys will not work until you log in to the pc and let every driver load in and then ""update the keyboard firmware"" in the software. (steelseriesengine3) the keyboard will flash until that is done. if you plug in the keyboard directly to your pc everything will work fine 100% of the time. other than that, the lights look absolutely insane (good) the switches are fine (SteelSeries browns) but the only problem I have with them is that when you press one down you will feel the slight tactile bump but then you will need to press the key like 1/100000000000 of an inch more to get it to actuate. if you pretty much only ever type you wont REALLY feel a difference and if this is your first Mechanical keyboard you definitely won't feel a difference but when your gaming and you don't press the keys down all the way 80% of the time you'll sometimes feel it. its not tooo big of a deal though. but if you absolutely couldn't deal with that you could I guess swap the switches out (I think their hot swappable but I could be wrong) and maybe even treat your self to some holy panda's or something along those lines.but for a big summary, switches are decent, the wrist rest is nice but if you slam the top down the whole thing will go backwards, I have generally large hands from my experience (G502 mouse if a bit short in length for me in a claw grip) because I often find myself moving the wrist rest beck a little, OLED display is totally overkill but totally sick (on AMD processors the app ""system monitor"" doesn't work for now but possible update coming) and stabilizers are nice, form factor is also nice.

It's a great keyboard but let me get the one con out of the way. the keys are super responsive so you can have situations where you trigger a key and have no clue what's going on only to realize your palm or thumb is resting on a stray key, but this could just be me.Also, if you are holding like say the A key and press D to move right the last key pressed doesn't override the new one so you have to let go of the first key.Here are some quick pros though. It IS SICK!!! looks great and keys feel great to press. The usb port on the upper left is powered and can charge a phone or I would assume run headsets. Easy to clean and quite a few customization options, love the form factor as I don't need a 10 key!

Its decent for vsrg games but my A key is beginning to have issues after 800k key presses. For the price it isn't too bad but I was kinda hoping it would last a bit longer. My Ducky Shine 5 lasted 5 years before dying on me. It had roughly 120 million key presses total on all keys before death. Most likely I'm going to try out wooting keyboards next as they are supposedly well built.

I love this keyboard, I really do. But after about 2.5 years, I have started to have problems with it recognizing key-presses in some keys. Started with the L-Shift key and then a couple weeks later the Backspace key started to require multiple presses to function.  I also began experiencing some difficulty with the Spacebar.  Thinking that it was some problem with the larger keys, I went through the steps to thoroughly clean and lube the switches. That seemed to work for a bit, but after another few weeks, I was back to key presses being hit-or-miss. Again, I like the keyboard but I think it might have a bit of a limited lifespan.  I hope your's lasts longer!

yuckypants;much higher quality than expected;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Blue ‚Äì Tactile & Clicky;Verified Purchase;March 4, 2023;United States;"
My requirements for a keeb are as follows: TKL, RGB, blue switches, with decent software that can control macros and RGB. This one hits ALL of the needs. The only reason this is getting 4 stars out of 5 is the fact that the switches are soldered in and if any need to be replaced, it's going to be major surgery or a replacement. It also makes it impossible to lube the switches when they're still installed.I hate the fact that this is an older model because the major brands all have their own switches now that are either ""like mechanical"" or some adjustable style. I just want blues - Cherry, Gateron, Kailh, whatever, but not some Steelseries or Razer brand.The software is not the best I've used either, but it's far superior to GMMKs or Duckys (completely non-existent).Overall, I'm enjoying this keeb and hope to for many more years to come.

M. Hall;Excellent Mid-Priced Gaming Board;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown ‚Äì Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;September 14, 2023;United States;"
The construction is very solid, with an aluminum chassis that has little flex. It's quite substantial feeling for a small board. The keycaps feel solid, if maybe a little more slick than I personally prefer, but it's easy enough to adjust to. The switches function well for both gaming and typing (I went with the brown, for that extra bit of tactile feedback.) While these aren't Cherry switches, they feel good and I've noticed not a single ghost or double press. Sadly, they are hard-wired and not swap-able, so bear that in mind when picking out your model (Red, Blue, and Brown are available.)  The wrist-rest feels good, though the soft-touch surface is kind of a dust magnet.

Got this back in 2019 and if I told you the amount of abuse this has been through, you'd be shocked to see that this beast is still in nice shape. Sturdy is definitely the word I'd use to describe the build quality, the case seems to be a hard plastic but isn't a cheap type of feel. This keyboard has some weight to it to let you know it isn't playing around. I can't think of how many times I raged and with my fist raised all the way up to the sky, punched down as hard as I could over and over until my hand hurt, keyboard still intact. RGB works great and the software lets you change the effect and color of each individual key if needed. Has buttons to change brightness of the LEDs from the keyboard itself. Favorite part of the keyboard is the media keys, a scroll wheel that lets you turn the volume up or down as well as mute and another button beside it to completely pause whatever is playing. A little extra is the screen in the corner where you can display pretty much anything you want and I think certain games have popups available to display stats if you're into that. For a non custom generic gaming keyboard out of all the top brands like ASUS and CORSAIR, steelseries definitely should be up there for a keyboard that does what it needs to, looks great and is built to last for years (and take abuse... Apex did it I swear).

Jeremiah;An Amazing Mechanical Keyboard;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Blue ‚Äì Tactile & Clicky;Verified Purchase;October 8, 2020;United States;"
The Apex 7 TKL is my first mechanical keyboard and I absolutely love it. I chose the blue switches cause I really enjoy the loud and clicky keys. The RGB illimitation is bright but not over the top, and is pretty accurate in terms of color preciseness. The sleek and slim design of the keyboard is very aesthetically pleasing and works with any setup. The magnetic wrist rest is very comfortable, and it is not a fingerprint magnet. The cable management is great because of the three different route options, so you can have the cable come out through the left, middle, or right side. The OLED display is definitely a nice addition to display text or GIFs. Is it unnecessary? Yes, it can be, but at the price you're paying, I feel like it's a nice extra added onto the keyboard.Overall, the compatibility with the SteelSeries Engine makes the brand a top choice for peripherals, especially if you like RGB and smooth integration of your peripherals. I would definitely recommend this keyboard.

I have no complaints about this keyboard itself. The wristrest is a little hard, but that's just my opinion. I already had a wristrest so I didn't even consider it part of the purchase. I used to have a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate and recently switched to this SteelSeries Apex TKL w/ Blue Switches. The switches feel great, you know exactly when they actuate and have a nice crisp clicky sound. The lighting options are awesome and the colors look great.I thought about going for a keyboard with the new optical switches but I was unsure of how they would feel and sound. This keyboard delivers exactly what I expected. I also replaced the orginal keycaps with some HyperX Pudding caps and it looks dope! There was nothing wrong with the stock caps, I just wanted additional aesthetic customization.I might throw some O-Rings onto WASD just to reduce the travel after actuation, which should make strafe-peaking and such easier in games like Valorant/CSGO.I easily recommend this keyboard.

I dont know how hard other people smash their keyboards after losing a match of fortnite but this thing is a dream.

It isn't the cheapest keyboard nor is it the most expensive. It has a great weight to it and the RGB is crisp with endless color options. It has served well as someone with a lighter keystroke than king kong.

What is not to like about this keyboard? Fully customizable RGB lighting. The clicky blue switches feel absolutely amazing, and sound fantastic. The 10 keyless gives me so much space on my desk for my mouse while I am gaming. It has a USB port on the keyboard you can use for your mouse or for other lighting options you can purchase (I.E.- I have a light bar plugged into my keyboard I use to back light my monitor.) You also can't leave out the fact that it has media controls on the keyboard as well. It has everything you want in an aesthetically pleasing keyboard for a great price. Other keyboards that run more than 120.00 are falling short compared to this beauty. 10/10 would recommend to anyone I know.

First off this is an excellent keyboard, the typing experience on it is great (if a bit loud, but that's what you're getting with blue switches like I did). Every piece of it just seems very high quality to me from the keys to the base and wrist-rest, its incredibly solid feeling and honestly the only feature that I could ask for is if it had a headphone-jack and detachable cord. I thought the software was very easy to use and didn't have any trouble setting it up. After using it for a bit however I question if the unique OLED in the corner was worth the price-premium, I've found that while cool, I basically just don't use it.

I mostly bought this keyboard because other ones were out of stock (thanks covid-19.) It's a pretty nice keyboard, but I think the idea to use some of the budget to put OLED screens in this keyboard nobody cares about was stupid.I think for the price the keyboard is, throwing in a Left row of Macros or a better USB I/O would've been really nice.Still, I don't think I can throw anything lower than a 4-star on it. The keyboard is serving me well. The only downside I see is that the switch life on these are 50m compared to 100m on Cherry MX or Razer's switches.

The keyboard is awesome. Great size and functionality. The colors are great.I gave the keyboard four stars because SteelSeries does not offer Mac keycaps (buy them from a competitor) and the software frequently glitches so you can't actually change settings. Fortunately, once the color profiles and buttons are set the software isn't needed. When the software does decide to load, it's awesome.

The OLED is a nice touch but I don't care too much about that. I plan on just using random gifs on there. Love the wrist rest and everything else though.

I bought this after my cat ruined my $150 Corsair keyboard and this had just come out so I figured I'd give it a shot. Totally glad I did. I personally prefer smaller keyboards as my older Corsair was taking up a lot of space on my already huge desk. The wrist rest is absolutely amazing too. It's a nice, thick matte black finish. Much better than just a piece of hard plastic you rest another padded rest on.It also have the option to put a picture on your screen in the top right hand corner which is kinda cool but not totally necessary. Just a cool add on.

Does not take up very much space and keys have a nice action when you hit them.  Lights on keyboard are just right.

Okay i wasn‚Äôt that into keyboards when i bought this and i still use it and am happy with it. but now that I know more i‚Äôm kinda unhappy with the stabilizers. they are pretty clacky and even though every other key sounds good with red switches the space bar enter bar and caps lock is just icky to press.

Perfect mechanical keybord but got few soures of light, that can not be regualted. First is USB Pass Through that is a little projector, that can not be turned by program way, the only way to turn it off is to plug out it from PC USB pass through connection. Second source is multimedia button that can not be turned off any way at all. In my case it was very important to turn off all led with working pc sometimes, and that is this keybord just can not do at all.

March;great gaming keyboard!! worth it!!;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Red ‚Äì Linear & Quiet;Verified Purchase;February 18, 2021;United States;"
for a few weeks' usages, SteelSeries Apex 7 TKL is great (red switch). just want to let the next buyer know that if you buying the Red switch, you probably want to lube the switch because if you crazily press a certain key like me, the switch will starting to have loud spring noise, so lube the switch will help a lot on the pressing experience as well as the sound quality. Secondly, the cable is super thick, I looking forward to seeing the change with it.

Red switches feel like butter. Keys move so gently and nice, very quiet, bright, FULL RGB with sick presets, and not to mention the OLED, which has built in gaming presets for like CSGO, and plenty of others; you can also make game oled things yourself!

BillyJoe;Love and Hate;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Blue ‚Äì Tactile & Clicky;Verified Purchase;January 13, 2021;United States;"
I love the sound of the keys. The colors are great! What I hate is the stiff cord... I game from the couch, and setting down the keyboard and the cord is all twisted and in the air. I trip over it often. I realize that if I was at a desk this wouldn't be a problem. This observation is for couch gamers.

G;Beautiful, functional, and very annoying.;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Brown ‚Äì Tactile & Quiet;Verified Purchase;October 5, 2019;United States;"
Excellent tkl keyboard, but missing some features expected of brand new designs mainly a removable cable, and/or a USB C Cable. Additionally, the colors are fantastic but when I play CS:GO there are two rows that simply refuse to follow the set colors and always default to green and blue. I can not figure out how to change this, and the manual does not elaborate. I've had to turn the lights all the way off since it really annoys me.

It's a great keyboard.  I use it for gaming and work. I don't miss the number pad. My desk is small so it's a perfect fit.For Ergonomic, I gave it a three, due to the keys being close together, great for gaming, but as an Ergonomic standpoint, not so much; Keyboard is straight, it's not curved, so it can put so strain on the wrist after a few hours.Overall I love it, it can be a great, get feet wet, into Mechanical Gaming due to price.

Dbott;Perfect Gaming Keyboard;Size: Apex 7 TKLStyle: Red ‚Äì Linear & Quiet;Verified Purchase;August 12, 2019;United States;"
This keyboard is hands down my favorite I've used so far. Started from a Corsair Strafe to an Apex M750 and now to the Apex 7 TKL w/ cherry switches. I am glad I did. The extra space for the mouse on the mousepad (I use an XXL reflex lab mousepad) is fantastic. The OLED screen, while some find it to be gimmicky, I find is pretty cool. On the fly settings access without going into the engine software is a really nice feature.For the price, I don't think you can find a better TKL keyboard. Highly recommend.

It's a keyboard it types stuff and the keycaps light up.  But more seriously I bought this to switch from my Razer greens the clicky just started to get to me so I went with the browns and it's nice and quite and smooth. Only downside is Razer made it right with a padded wrist rest. This wrist rest is soft feeling but not padded.  I just have a gif running on my oled screen so can't say much about it.

The keyboard feels very comfy and the config easy very easy to setup. Brown switch is the best option for gaming and typing. It comes with a detachable wrist rest and it‚Äôs super comfy. I would give it a 5 stars if it has detachable USB-C cable.

I have had this keyboard for about 4 months and have nothing bad to say about it. It look really good with the RGB lights and some of the light functions are pretty cool. The board itself seems like it's made with quality parts that are tough and able withstand my abusive hands. I use it for gaming and it makes it much more of a enjoyable experience.  You get what you pay for.

I've only had one other *real* gaming keyboard before this one and this one I like a lot better. It's easy to type on and its led's are bright. Also the OLED pannel is fun to play with. Overall, I don't think I'll be buying another keyboard in a while.

I love the smooth but tactile feel of the switches. The wrist rest is not like a pillow, but I have grown to like it a lot. The only negative I have is the cable is very stiff and thick. It was hard for me to route it through my desk because of how chunky it is. Otherwise, a very solid and worth it buy!

This is aesthetically gorgeous, feels amazing, and works incredibly well. There's always a bit of a honeymoon with a new piece of tech--usually a couple days. I still find myself looking down, feeling the texture of the steel frame. Everything about this is clever, well designed. The RGB effects are easy to set up and work on a Mac. Very happy with this purchase.

First off, this was the first mechanical keyboard that I have ever owned. I am very pleased and happy with this purchase. I chose the brown switches because I've heard that they're good for typing and gaming overall. The rgb is consistent and you are able to change it with the steelseries software. The oled display is a cool feature to have. Overall, 10/10
