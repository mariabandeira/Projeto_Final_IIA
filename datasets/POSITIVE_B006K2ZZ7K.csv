This salt Water Taffy assortment is the absolute best!  Just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy my sweet tooth. Each piece was soft and chewy. A very good variety of flavors in the bag. The flavors were tasty, as well. I didnt not encounter any that were terrible. Great buy!I paid full price for this product and this is my honest and unbiased review

I bought this for my son's graduation party and still have LOTS left over, but that's fine by me. The taffy is delicious! You get lots of different flavors in the assortment, and the price when you buy in bulk online like this can't be beat. I saw someone complained about the taffy sticking to the wrappers, but I think that's nitpicking, and probably has more to do with the temperature where the candy is being stored than the quality of the taffy, which is excellent.You can definitely taste and identify the many different flavors in this assortment. The party store has cheap taffy that is HORRIBLE--rubbery, and unidentifiable flavors to boot!  Our local candy shop wants an outrageous $10+ per pound for bulk candy, so while their stuff tastes just fine, it just diesn't make sense economically. I would definitely go with this seller and this product again!

So many flavors, some I've never had.  I will definitely buy again.  So far almost all have a great texture, a few have been a bit too soft but better that than stale and hard.  Price is fair, I can buy at Sprouts for $3.99 lb.

David C. Sullivan;Great!  Just as good as the expensive brands!;0;Verified Purchase;June 20, 2012;United States;"
This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!

The flavors are definitely different they're tangy at first some of my thought through a little musty but I guess that's the way they're made but I don't know this will go on my good list

I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.

Great tasting taffy that was fresh & with more flavors than I knew existed. The only thing that would have been better is if the maker would make a pictorial guide to what the colors/flavors are and inserted it into the bag.

The family really enjoyed this taffy. A nice variety of flavors. If you are hooked on one certain flavor, I suggest you buy it separately as there are not many duplicate flavors. My faves are banana and black licorice.

Danielle DiCola;So much variety of flavors! An amazing product! Must buy!;0;;January 4, 2020;United States;"
Thought this product needs a recent review. At first I looked at the reviews For this item. But there's a lot of people saying that this product is bad. In my honest opinion they are amazing! They are packaged exceptional there's none leaking gout of the bag. A big variety some flavors do have less of but I think it's just that it's random how much of a flavor is put into the bag. The price is awesome. Some of the taffy is a little bit hard but I think it's due to the fake of the type of weather you are in. But as you chew some pieces they do start to melt in your mouth. This is by far the best product as of Taffy's I bought there are some that are more soft but I do not complain the flavors are amazing. So much variety. A lot of other product like this have very few flavories but iv already had like 30 flavores already of this product,and they are delirious. The taste is awesome. Mainly for the hardness in some of the taffy just set it out on room temperature they tend to get softer. Great for many occasions. Some people are just picky cause they like certain flavors. But they are still amazing. This product needs better reviews. Very delicious. It won't last long but I do love products like taffy having many variety in the product. Absolutely amazing. Best taffy product by far as of the variety. Will defiently by this product again. So if you see this review I highly recommend for you to get this project. The feeling and the texture being soft or hard is due to were it's packaged but it does make them last longer. But overall this is amazing. Though it does not have the list of flavors I got to say that there are many more then I'd thought any product like this would have knowing I bought taffy before. But this definetly deserves 5 stars.
