Ls;what r u waiting for?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?;Color: White;Verified Purchase;December 23, 2023;United States;"
I’m in love!!!!Not so much with the price but with all of the extra time I have to myself.  I was hesitant to purchase a $1600 vacuum/ mop, but after reading at least 50 reviews on multiple websites… I was convinced. It took a lot longer to arrive bc it shipped directly from Roborock in Arkansas via UPS, so don’t be surprised if Amazon gets the delivery date wrong. I have never owned a robot.  I will say I have been tempted but I never believed they would actually do a good job.  This product is amazing!!!  She arrived Monday night at my house.  I put her together (attached the ramp) and plugged her in to charge.  I did put her in backwards, so pay attention to where the buttons r.  They go inside the machine.  I was met with an error 42 message that was not self explanatory. I wasn’t able to find a list of errors in the instruction manual and so I started to get really upset. Finally, I was able to find 1 person who got a response from Roborock.  Pull out the robot, remove the brush and the filter to the rt (on the dock) and put everything back.  That seemed to work.  At least at that point I didn’t feel like I wasted a fortune on something that was broken when it arrived.  I let it charge all night and found that it makes noise while it was charging.  The next morning I downloaded the app and let it start mapping the house.  I closed the door to the back bedroom bc that’s the room where everything goes to die and there is nowhere to even turn around in that room. The whole process took 14 minutes.  I did notice that it has trouble distinguishing btwn inside and outside when it comes into contact with sliding glass doors with no shades.  I eventually solved the problem by setting no go zones on the map. U can name each room and set up scheduled days for it to run.  Some people said it vacuums only on certain days and than mops on others but I haven’t figured out how to set the different schedules so I just have it vacuum and mop Sunday Wednesday and Friday.  She talks a lot so if u have a house that’s only 1 story… I don’t suggest running it while u r sleeping.  I set her to run at 2:30pm on the days I know no one is home. I would suggest watching the cleaning videos on YouTube.  Every so often u will have to flip over the robot and clean out the hair buildup as well as wipe out the dock. My boyfriend wants to do that project every 2 weeks so that she stays shinny and new.  The directions show a picture of a faucet dropping tap water in the clean water tank.  I live in Florida and we have SUPER hard water down here.  Every 2 years I have to throw out my kitchen faucet bc the parts rot away.  I would suggest spending the money on a jug of distilled water, but u will only get about 2 washes per gallon. My boyfriend and I can’t believe how clean the floor is at the house.  The 1st time I just used water.  The second time I added the recommended cleaning solution found on Roborocks website.  It costs about $19 for the bottle but u only use about a cap full per full water tank.  The app is really easy to use and u can watch the robot go back and forth on the app.  It tells u how long it’s been running and the battery life. U also get a notification when it starts and finishes on ur cellphone. Some people said the dirty water tank can smell over time so when I return home each night I just dump it outside and rinse it out in the sink.  The directions state that u should only run the vacuum the 1st 3xs but I don’t c a vacuum only button on the main screen.  I only saw clean and when I pushed it off she went.  She vacuums in the front and mops in the back.  I thought she would vacuum the entire house 1st and than gonback over it and mop, but that’s not how it works.  I only have 2 small microfiber mats in my house. She does make them a little wet when she’s ing them but almost not enough to notice.  It does push those rugs around a little while it’s , so I the future I might stick them down or replace them with rugs that stick to the floor.  I did throw out 2 throw rugs bc the robot kept trying to clean them and they were just getting bunched up.  It went under my ikea cabinets bc they r all on stilts. I was sure that it wouldn’t fit but by golly she made it in and out without any trouble. The floor under my bed that was full of dust is now shinny, but to be fair I gave it a quick wipe b4 she started the master bedroom. My parents are now considering buying another company’s model bc I’m soooo happy with mine.  I did warn them that other reviews mentioned owning many other models over the years and felt like they wasted their money. I’m glad I decided to spend the money bc I love coming home to a spotless, shinny floor.  Hopefully having the floor cleaned more often will force me to keep the rest of the house cleaner.  Don’t wait just buy this product and make ur life a whole lot easier than it should be.  Give urself the chance to do something else with that 1 1/2 u r gonna gain not vacuuming and mopping ur house.  I have been telling all of my customers about my new toy and how much I deserved it.  1 lady told me she had a Roborock vacuum only model and that she loved it.  It is awesome that u can watch the mop on the app as it goes around ur house… everytime I get a notification that it is starting… I wait about 45 minutes and than I turn on the app to see what she has already accomplished and its invigorating.  Also all of the people I have spoken to who say they have a robotic vacuum/mop have NEVER and I repeat NEVER used the mopping function on their vacuum… and the reason…….bc they have to add an attachment to the robot to turn it into a mop… with the Roborock its already done for u.  All u have to do is add the water.  It fills itself.  It empties itself.  It cleans itself.  It never gets stuck.  It dries itself…. What are u people waiting for other than a sale… go buy this product today and wait the week for it to arrive so u can add precious time back to ur life!  It took me a couple of days to complete this review to make sure I got every positive thing I could remember about it.  I hope this review was helpful.

lizaq;The bomb!!!;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;December 10, 2023;United States;"
This vacuum is amazing so far! In anticipation of getting it, I got myself all worked up and stressed out about setting it up. It was so easy. Step by step guide and then an app. Once you unwrap it, you plug it in and then download the app. You’ll start out mapping your house. All you need to do is connect it to your internet and then you turn it on and let it go thru your house to get the full map. It does all the work!  After that you can go into each room on the map and create fake walls if you want it to avoid certain areas such as going under the bed. It got to the basement stairs and just backed up. Then I ran the first cleaning with both the vacuum and the mop with plain water. It mops and then it appears it dries as it goes. I’m not quite sure about that, but just know your floors are not soaking wet after it goes over it. No streaks and our hardwoods look beautiful! It went thru the whole house, but I noticed that it had only vacuumed one strip in the back bedroom so I was concerned. Well after it completed all of the mopping areas it went all the way back to the other side of the house and completed a full vacuum of that bedroom. Each time I think it’s going to miss a piece of fuzz or something else it goes back and gets it. I empty the dirty water bin and it’s disgusting! I can run it each day and the water is disgusting. How is that possible? Now I just added the concentrated soap that goes with it and there’s no smell at all and the water is even dirtier. You can set up schedules for vacuuming and mopping or just vacuuming. I let it run a full vacuum and mop twice a week at 10 am and then I set it on quiet mode and let it vacuum just the main areas of the house two days a week at 1 am. I love that you can pick which rooms you want done and what time. We can’t even hear it running. The vacuum seems to be pretty strong. However, I will say that on a couple areas of the living room hard wood floors, it’s not getting flush with all of the baseboards so there is a little dust remaining, but barely. So you still need to do a little bit of cleanup with maybe a swiffer. It comes with two bags for where the dirt goes when it’s emptied. I have no idea how long those will last, but I’m sure the app will tell me when it’s full. It did get hung up on one cord so far and got stuck under a chair, both times the app sends a notification. So far it’s been a great investment, which I got for $400 off during Black Friday week, so they do go on sale occasionally. Hope this review was helpful because these were some of my main questions.

ArynBergman;Not cheap but worth every penny;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;September 3, 2023;United States;"
Years ago I had tested a Roomba and was disappointed.  The Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is my first robot vacuum mop combo and I'm beyond impressed.Pros-Easy to use.-Works well.  I've inspected the floor after it was done cleaning with a UV flashlight and it picks up most plastic dust that would have been left behind by the other one.- The auto-mapping is awesome.-Ditto with the app.- Efficient.  Doesn't use much power, water, nor the cleaning solution (recommended too but not necessary)Cons- Doesn't get all of the plastic dust so there's room for improvement.- Pricey but again, worth it.- Kind of slow.  There's settings to speed it up but at the cost of the quality of cleaning.- Not as set it and forget it for 7 weeks like they advertise.  Its best to prep the area by setting chairs on tables and taking anything else that can be temporarily be moved off of the floor.  Not critical but goes faster and seems to do a better job.  The water needs to be refilled every couple of runs for about 1000 sq ft of tile floor.  The funk water should be dumped after every clean otherwise it can get pretty nasty quick.-Cords vs Roborock: cords win every time so be sure they're tucked away.Update: after about a month of use, the clean water tank started to grow mildew and smelled like a dirty fish tank.  Contacted Roborock support and they said to clean with citric acid water mix 1 tablespoon per cup of water) and that did the trick.  Cleaned the dirty water tank too with it.  Now, we only fill the tank enough to do a full cleaning, empty any remaining water along with the dirty water tank, and let them both air dry before closing.  So far so good.

In Awe;I absolutely L.O.V.E this Vacuum;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;August 14, 2023;United States;"
I waited for about 6 weeks to write this review because sometimes, a product works well at first but the more you use it the more you find its flaws!This vacuum is amazing!  I have 3 dogs and 3 kids and this vacuum helps keep me sane.  I run the vacuum and mop 4 days a week and just the vacuum 2 days.  The other day I sweep and mop myself.Pros:* Easy to set up and quickly mapped out my house.* Takes very little maintenance.  Just fill clean water and empty the dirty water every 3 or 4 days.  I had a Shark combo robot previously and it couldn't even get thru 1 cleaning without me having to manually add water.  If you leave the dirty water any longer than that it will smell.  I didn't notice it from the machine but when you empty it, you will smell it.  It has been 6 weeks and I have just today emptied the debris bag and I have 2 Aussies and a Golden Retriever that shed A LOT.* It really maintains itself, cleaning mop head every 15 minutes and self empties its dust bin. The Shark vacuum only self empties the dust bin if you are only vacuuming.  If you are using the combo vacuum/mop, EVERYTHING is manual for the Shark. Roborock rocks with this feature.  I do not have to do ANYTHING for days.* App is easy to use and makes suggestions for no go zones.* I can see what the vacuum is doing or any errors thru the app and sometimes can clear them remotely.Cons* Expensive but I think well worth the price* Like others have said, has a difficult time with cords, however, I bought cord organizers with boxes and ties from Amazon and fixed this issue.* Sometime gets stuck on my rug but usually I just start it again remotely and it unsticks itselfI was worried about spending so much for a vacuum/mop but I am in love with this.  I have had other robot vacuums and mops and this one is head and shoulders about the others.  I did NOT get anything for free either.  I paid full price for my Roborock.

J. Dyer;Clean floors and hyper accurate mapping;Color: White;Verified Purchase;February 9, 2024;United States;"
I’ve had many robot vacuums, high-end iRobot and Neato robots (until they totally lost the plot) and this one is by far the best yet.The mapping capabilities are outstanding: fully mapped 2400 sq feet in under 9 minutes and the map was perfect the first time. Unlike the iRobot mapping, the Roborock doesn’t make the maps worse with each clean, it only improves the maps with new detail (an open door for example).The quality of the cleaning, especially the mop is surprisingly good. Since it cleans the mop head it’s not just pushing around wet dirt. I’ve noticed a considerable improvement in cleanliness running the mopping nightly in my kitchen after dinner. The floor stays bright and clean. I have tile and it doesn’t do much on the grout, I can see it’s going to need to be manually cleaned but that’s trivial compared with o the overall clean of the floors.It does well on carpet too, and coping with area rugs. It’s sensitive to where a rug ends and turns on the mop when it’s off the rug. A complaint about vacuuming tiled areas is that it reduces the suction power and can miss bits between tile and a rug but it’s a minor complaint.I’ve owned the vacuum for 3 months and so far it’s been 100% reliable, it got stuck once on a cat toy, but avoided every other obstacle exceptionally well. There’s been very little wear on the wheels or brushes that I can see so far. I use both plain water and about half the time add cleaner to it. The cleaner is crazy concentrated so a bottle would last probably a year or more for me. Hopefully for the price this unit lasts for several years.I have my vacuum docked in a place that has carpet and found that it cannot realign on carpet well enough to dock to clean the mop. My solution was to put a board down and cover it with contact paper (to keep the minimal water off the board). My board extends one robot-length in front of the charging station and the robot can reposition itself for mop cleaning perfectly now. Something to consider if you can’t put the base on tile or wood floors.The app works well and is easy to use, no complaints there at all for usability but it sends a notice that a cleaning run was completed every time. This is silly, I only need to see a notice when there was a problem. It’s a minor annoyance but makes it harder to look through the message log for problems when it’s overwhelmed with trivial ‘successful’ messages. You can’t mute the voice prompts, but you can turn their volume way down.

Andrea Gonzalez;Great vacuum;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;January 21, 2024;United States;"
I bought this robot vac after my cleaning lady quit, as my white tile floor gets extremely dirty with 2 crazy shedding dogs (corgi and husky), a cat and 2 messy cooker humans.My parents had a 2020 iRobot vacuum and it was honestly very disappointing. It always got stuck in cliffs, constantly got lost, and always had errors preventing it from following the set schedule, so I was skeptical.I couldn’t be more happy with this purchase. It’s been just about two months of use, I run this almost everyday to keep the place presentable and I have yet to replace the dust bag (will probably be this week). It requires the perfect amount of work, and have only had to reboot maybe twice. I do regular vacuuming and mopping throughout the week with this thing with the deep+ option always on and never let it vac/mop simultaneously, I always have it do it separately. Once a week I remove items like chairs, trash cans, dog beds, dog crates, and any  other easily movable objects to other rooms to have it get the hairs that build up in random places.It usually does a great job at getting everything clean in the first go, although it does struggle a bit with tough stains in my kitchen, but spraying them with water before usually does the trick. I also like using the remote control option if it’s just not handling it correctly (takes 5min out of my time, and minimal physical effort.I refill and empty bins once or twice a week. And  remove any stuck hairs between brushes also once a week, i love how everything is easily removed.The only thing i hate is that rotating sweeping brush that’s on the side, because it bends due to it hitting walls and other objects. But it comes out brand new after putting the bristles in boiling water for a few seconds.Great purchase overall. It’s also very entertaining watching it clean. My cat has a vendetta against it, and is always taking it out of the base. A bit inconvenient with multiple level homes because you have to pick it up after it’s done. But that’s not the robot’s fault.

DizziD;A huge upgrade from the S5 and impressively hassle-free to use even in a 6k sqft house;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;May 11, 2023;United States;"
We decided to upgrade to the S8 Pro Max after using the S5 with great success for 3 years, and it basically took everything we liked about the predecessor and improved on it. As long as you're working within the type of environments that are good for floorbots (mostly hard floors and short rugs, and a reasonably controlled amount of clutter), this is the best one we've ever owned.Pros:- Initial mapping is VERY quick compared to previous versions- Slightly larger map/storage capacity for floorplans- Cleans faster and more effectively than the previous models- Very solid battery life for a very large house (650 sq feet takes about 25% of the battery and 1 hour)- Moderately quieter than predecessors- Mop cleaning system works very well and seems to eliminate the old ""dirty rag"" mopping approach- Good at avoiding things that will trip it up (rarely gets stuck - maybe once a month with daily use)- Dock system actually works and minimizes daily maintenance (the bin ends up surprisingly clean)- Doesn't seem to have any issues with pet hair (a German Shepherd and a Husky, so we're not messing around here!)- Locates missing shoesCons:- Dust bags will not last the implied month in a large house with pets and $5 a month in vacuum bags seems a bit much- App alerts to refill/empty dock bags and reservoirs would have been helpful- Don't let it near a shag rug. Ever.- Map management (especially initial room division) is still clunky, but is better than before.- The inability to rotate ""spot cleaning"" zones makes them a lot less useful unless your house is perfectly square and facing a cardinal direction (see pic)- Still can't save cleaning zones for areas that you regularly spot clean.Good to know:- Dusbtin emptying is very loud - not louder than a normal vacuum, and perfectly reasonable - but not something you want to do at night or during dinner.- Disable schedules if you have a sick pet - obstacle avoidance is great but it still can't detect a puddle of yacked-up kibble and will track it all over your house.- Even in a fairly clean home, frequent mop washing (the 20 minute default is pretty good) will still go through a lot of water - check the tanks often.- You may want to stock up on dust bags - with 2 dogs and running about 2 hours a day, we are going through a bag every other week. It does do an admirable job packing them full, though.

I love my old Roborock. Actually it's not even super old. But with this S8 Pro Ultra, they have fixed a few things that drove me crazy.1- Black lines on the carpet are no longer mistaken as drop offs. My rugs have bold black lines in the pattern, and I almost got rid of them with the S7, even though I love them. With S7 I had to have my rugs blocked out as no go zones because machine was going to get ""stuck"" and call for help. You can imagine that with 3 dogs, this was aggravating. S8 goes right over the same lines without a problem.2- Automatic mop wash and dry, with onboard storage of both fresh and used mop water. With S7 I had to fill the water bin every day, and I felt I also needed to remove and scrub the mop pad.3- Smart threshold detection. I have a piece of trim running across the seam where my hardwood ends and kitchen tile begins. It isn't a huge height, but S7 fought with it and wasted a lot of energy and made a lot of noise trying to get over it. S8 kind of worked for it the first few cleanings- but then it sent me a notification. It had detected the ""threshold"". I verified the threshold location on the map, and whatever it does differently now is working. No more fights to get over the lip.S8 Pro Ultra is BIG because of the water storage tanks. But this was expected and is perfectly fine with me.Keep them coming Roborock! I just know that someday you'll have a robot vacuum who does stairs. Lol.

ctw;Works as stated;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;April 14, 2024;United States;"
Came on time, was well-packed, went together easily with clear instructions, and connected to wifi quickly. The app is very good, you can choose any days of the week and any time to run. We wanted every 3 days which was not an option as far as I can see, so picked 2 days a week. This does have the benefit of knowing which days to pick up a bit for the vac& mop. For example, moving a long hair throw rug we don't want vacuumed. Also, it got stuck in the forest of chair legs under a table one time, so now we'll move one or two chairs to make that navigation a bit easier. After buying this I read a review that pointed out that spinning mop heads clean better than this style, which is my only regret. But with only 2 adults in the house, the periodic wipe down from this large mop head is sufficient for us. For the ~1150 sq ft on our 1st floor, it does 5-7 mop cleans/ refills (yeah, same space, different runs). Sometimes it docks for a recharge at around 25% battery, sometimes it can finish w/o a recharge. Haven't seen where to change the recharge point as it gets very close to finishing every time (within 10%).

We have been faithful Roborock owners for years as we truly love all the products! We received our new Roborock and it was unfortunately malfunctioning shortly after we received it. The customer service was absolutely phenomenal in assisting with repairs and ultimately replacing for a brand new vacuum. We couldn’t be more pleased with the support we received. This vacuum does it all. The mop feature is the best of any vacuums we have owned and keeps our floors looking so fresh everyday! I love that it is rather self sufficient and can get through more than one mop cycle before needing fresh water refilled into the tank. The mapping is also great as it can detect obstacles and recognize flooring transitions easily. I look forward to coming home each day to clean floors! Would definitely purchase again!

I moved my other brand robot floor cleaner to the second floor after a few weeks of having this work for me. This one is impressive.I schedule my main room floors to be cleaned where the most traffic occurs every night. The setting is on quiet so it does not disturb our sleep. (The self emptying sound is louder but for me the dock is in the opposite end of the house.)I use the super vacuum setting for the wall to wall carpeting. It's helped my rug to look so much better.I start the machine as needed for other floors in the house.The self cleaning mop works very well.I have been inspired to find other places for boxes that were stored under furniture now that my floors look so good.The roborock is very good at avoiding obstacles that were not there when mapping or even the last time it cleaned.I would buy it again.

I recently moved into a bigger house with an open floorplan and all tile floors. With kids, dogs, and cats, I was wondering about how I was ever going to keep the floors halfway clean. I was looking at basic robot vacuums and then was looking at the mop by the big brand name competitor, but the reviews were just so so and I hated having to have multiple devices.I came across this machine and balked at the price, so I kept scrolling... except I kept coming back to it so I finally closed my eyes and clicked add to cart.This thing is amazing! I'm still in the process of moving so sone days I can't run it due to stuff being everywhere, and boy do I notice a difference on those days! So far this thing not only does everything it advertises, but does it WELL! Only complaint is it's constantly thwarted by the bathroom mat, but I'm pretty sure I can set that as a no go area, I just haven't gotten around to it.

bogometer;Pricy vacuum that is worth the money;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;April 24, 2024;United States;"
It mapped my home and had a few problems with carpets with fringes.  I set some no go zones and now it is on a schedule and totally automatic.  Vacuums and mops on schedule.  I don't do it anymore.  I have to empty the waste bag and waste water (and give it new water) occasionally when it tells me.  Once in great while it gets stuck and asks for help but mostly hands free. It does have an annoying habit of saying ""going to wash the mop"" whenever it wants to clean but the fact that it does it and I don't have to change the mop brush much is a win.  Works way better than my sister's roomba which she basically quit using.

So if this thing lasts its worth $1200 to us. I 3d printed shelves and risers for furniture and appliances so everything is off the floor 4in and our cabinets don't have toe kicks. Best to mop and vacuum twice the first pass softens the dirt and the second finishes it off. Have not cleaned the mop yet or changed the dust bag nor cleaned  the dustbin filter all have self cleaned well. When the dustbin no longer empties on max power its time for a new bag but hasn't happened  yet. The mop filter gets washed monthly  on the 3rd rack in a Bosch 800 series dishwasher comes out spotless. Does not suck up catliter well but the mop sure does. No scratches on the tile or hardwood and the rugs stay clean even with 2 dogs and four mega fluffy cats which the app shows as dog or cat icon when they don't move. It showed a poop icon when my wife didn't move ...im never letting that down. We use vinegar and water and everybody comments on how clean the floors always are.  I just smile.

I fell in love with this thing right off the bat after using Roombas for years. But I will say my Roombas never broke down, not once. This Roborock has broken down 4 times in 3 weeks and the main culprit is the LiDAR turret which serves as the robot's vision sensor, so if it breaks, it doesn't work at all. It continually thinks something is obstructing the turret's view (not the case) and I have to take the robot apart, rotate the turret, (redundantly) clean it, and put it back together and hope it resets things. Fourth breakdown this morning and I've taken it apart and put it back together 3 times to no avail, so this thing is completely useless now. I am reaching out to customer support hoping for a total replacement of the robot itself and will update this review after I hear back.UPDATE: Adjusted to 5 stars. Customer support team process took a bit of extra time by requesting a video upload of the original vacuum malfunctioning prior to sending a replacement. The replacement they sent has been working great the last several weeks and their support team has been patient with me in mailing off the original one as I have been juggling personal affairs that have eaten up all my time. Looks like my original vacuum was indeed a defect. This thing works great for early morning routines -- I have 2 huskies who obviously do their share of shedding and rainy/muddy days are very tough without the roborock. It's amazing coming downstairs in the morning and seeing the floors immaculately cleaned. Much better product than the Roombas I've moved off of.

Ellie wang;Disappointing Experience with Roborock S8 Pro Ultra - Water Leakage Issue;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;March 18, 2024;United States;"
I purchased the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop from the RockDock Ultra Series about two months ago, attracted by its advanced features such as auto drying, auto mop washing, self-emptying, self-refilling, liftable dual brush & sonic mop, 6000Pa suction, and obstacle avoidance. Initially, I was impressed with the innovative technology and the promise of a hassle-free cleaning experience.Unfortunately, my satisfaction was short-lived. Recently, we discovered a significant issue with the product: it leaks water everywhere during operation. This defect went unnoticed until it caused substantial damage to our expensive wooden flooring. The water leakage from the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra has destroyed the integrity of our floors, and we are now faced with the distressing reality of having to replace them—a process that will cost us thousands of dollars.%%%%%%%%%%%%%May 1，2024  update:  Because the device leaked, it caused a lot of damage to our floor. However, I have to say, the customer service was very friendly and responsible, and although it was past the return period, they still replaced it with a brand new one.

KenC;This Robo Vac is the BOMB!!;Color: White;Verified Purchase;February 19, 2024;United States;"
We have essentially stopped vacuuming our house with our stick vacuum.  Additionally, we haven't mopped a floor since we got this vac in Jan 2024.  The tech on this thing is impressive.  It took a few hours to map our home, but it did it with so much detail it was amazing.  It allowed us to block off very precise areas for the vacuum to avoid and set up scheduled room cleaning.  We have it vacuum and mop the kitchen every night at 8:30pm.  It took a couple of week to figure out how to adapt our home to this vacuum.  It's forced us to not leave things on the floor is some areas so the vacuum can do a complete job.  We have it run a whole house cleaning on Friday's where we pick up bath mats and other items so it can do a thorough job.  The vacuum loves a phone charging cord, so we've had to make sure these are not on the ground when it's at work.  Emptying the dirty water is easy and rather satisfying since you see how much dirt is being cleaned from the floor.  Another plus is the easy roller brush removal process and the ability to remove the end of the brush to remove longer hair that gets wrapped around it.  Other vacuums force you to cut this hair from the rollers.  Super convenient feature.Finally, I will say to set expectations accordingly.  This vacuum is not a set up and forget it type of technology.  It requires a few minutes a few times a week for maintenance and cleaning, but this is a small fraction of the time we would spend actually vacuuming and mopping.  Staying on top of maintaining the machine makes a big difference in its effectiveness.  Love this product!!!

I don’t write reviews unless they send me an email and I’m feeling a bit generous, but I am thrilled with the performance so far. We have had it about a month and a half, 44 cleanings, run it over wood floors with a few rugs. I’ve found that putting chairs up saves a bit of time navigating and gets more dust. But I run it every night. Setting up the rooms was glitchy but improved with a firmware update. I pick which rooms get vac and mopped and it just doesn’t. 44 x 1200 sf and I think I emptied water 6 times. Mop works great, doesn’t get stuck, don’t need to pay anyone to clean the main floor anymore!

I usually don’t write reviews.But this thing saves me a ton of time. I know longer vacuum or mop my hardwood floors and carpets.It has its limits, such as it’s too tall to clean under my cabinets, but that’s not an issue.LiDAR and obstacle avoidance works really well. App can be a buggy sometimes but not really an issue.Only thing I dislike is that it’s not smart enough to know when its dust bin is full mid cleaning. But from what I’ve read iRobot has a patent.If you’re on the fence, just get it!

Works great - after some customer service help!First of all, hit a snag right out of the gate with the bag not registering as installed for the vacuum portion of the dock. I was able to locate the email for customer service and shot off an email to get a ticket started. Pretty quick response time, and they had standard troubleshooting tips that i performed before they told me just to send it back. I was able to get the UPS label and drop it off (just took a picture of the receipt; didn't take a video of anyone), waited 4 days for the new one to arrive and it works a treat!Mapping is almost instantaneous, vacuum and mopping is efficient and the app is pretty easy to set up!Pretty excited to replace my two iRobot vacuum and mop for this one robot!

I love this product! The functionality is good. Unlike another brand that I owned, the Roborock S8 ultra does not get stuck all the time like a different brand I owned. The ability to intermittently clean the mop, refill,  and continue on is fantastic. It has made my life easier. It is fairly easy to clean and upkeep is directed through the app.  I truly appreciate this product.

Randall Stewart;This mop is an advancement in floor cleaning!!;Color: White;Verified Purchase;December 8, 2023;United States;"
So I have waited a week after we got our S8 setup and running in the house. We have white porcelain tiles (big ones 2x4') throughout the whole downstairs. The kitchen, Family room and foyer are close to 1500 sqft. And my wife, since buying the home in 2021, has been swearing the floors will kill her. White tile is hard to keep clean especially in the kitchen. So early on I bought a Roomba i7 and a Brava jet mop. Now they work more or less but often times they are ""lazy"". In that they don't dock right and then you have to notice that they are not doing there job and go futz with them to get them charging again. I have moved these guys out to other areas. The Brava jet worked as long as you dolled it out in small areas. Which means every day it I would have it deal with about 1/2 of the small tank on it. And every afternoon I would have to clean the pad and fill the little tank. Really quite a lot of work, and after about a year of doing that I just said forget it.. too much work for what you get out.I saw the S8 a while ago but the price put me off a bit.. I finally decided to splurge and try it. Wow is all I can say. It vacuums and mops  and it does so efficiently. Instead of just wandering around like the roomba's do it maps out the floor and goes back and forth like I would if I was mopping. Then periodically while mopping/vacuuming it pauses announces its going to wash the mop and goes back and does so.Even better we do have carpets down and it recognizes that, lifts its mop up and just vacuums those areas. It is just stunningly amazing. Our floors now are cleaned every day and even at that its amazing how much dirt it gets up. And the water reserve is great too, all I do is about every other day go down, dump and clean out the dirty water (and it is always grey let me tell you could have something to do with our puppy :D ) and then fill up the clean water bucket.This is truly a revolutionary advance in cleaning. I just can't say enough good things about it. Now the only question will be how long it holds up. If something happens I will update the review. And I did notice in the manual  every few weeks I will have to do a bit of cleaning and servicing.. but considering how wonderful it works I am fine with that!!

C;Amazingly self-sufficient robot!;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;November 19, 2023;United States;"
After three weeks of heavy usage, I really love this robot. I’m extremely impressed by its navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities and how close to hands-free it truly is. “Rosie” (of course!) has gotten/kept my house cleaner than it was for a long time. Rosie almost never gets stuck, especially now that we’ve identified a couple trouble spots to mark as no-go zones, and just goes about her business cleaning. My house is fairly large and is home to a cat and a dog, who like to shed everywhere. (It’s really neat when one of the animals sits in Rosie’s path long enough for the “cat” or “dog” icon to pop up on the map in the app!) I now have Rosie scheduled to vacuum high traffic areas every night, which keeps things under control. My downstairs is mostly hardwood and tile, with a few area rugs. The S8 Pro Ultra’s self-filling and self-washing makes the mopping functionality truly useful—it requires multiple refills to get my whole downstairs mopped, which would rarely happen if I had to refill by hand. Overall, this robot admirably meets my needs.My prior experience with a robot vacuum was roughly 18 years ago with the then base model Roomba. It was neat at first, but eventually felt like more trouble than it was worth. I was spending more time picking up the floor and unsticking/cleaning/emptying/maintaining the robot than it would take me to just hand vacuum the small condo I lived in at the time. I gave up on robot vacuuming until the technology advanced and, in the meantime, moved to the larger house with more extensive cleaning needs. The S8 Pro Ultra seemed to be the more advanced robot I was waiting for, and I have not been disappointed. This machine avoids most of the limitations of my old Roomba.I have noticed a couple of minor software issues that hopefully will get ironed out with future updates: 1. Some glitches with naming rooms on the maps, especially when trying to assign custom names. 2. Multi-level functionality could be a lot smoother. Getting the robot to switch maps is cumbersome, especially when you just want to do selective room cleaning on the new floor. And the robot then thinks its dock is on the new floor too. Other than these minor issues though, I find the app very good and useful.I have been so pleased with this robot that, last week, I got an S8+ at the Black Friday sale price to keep upstairs. My upstairs is mostly carpet, so the Pro Ultra’s mopping functionality is less needed up there.  So far, the S8+ is also meeting my expectations. And it’s fun having two robots at my command.

J.Steve;Great app, but cleaning power is lacking;Color: White;Verified Purchase;January 6, 2024;United States;"
THE GOOD:This unit has an amazing app.  It can save multiple maps so that it knows the rooms in each level of my house, and if I put it in a random spot and tell it to vacuum a given room, it'll correctly orient itself in ~20 seconds and do as requested.I can also use the app to highlight 1 or more specific area and it'll head straight there, which is great if we spill something on the floor etc.It is much quieter than my Roomba, both because the vacuum itself is quieter but also (importantly) because it doesn't bumble around bumping into things and causing a racket.  I also love that it vacuums room by room, so it'll fully complete a room before moving on to the next one (once you've defined each room on your map).  And the app lets you track its specific progress in real-time.It gets stuck less often than the Roomba since it's able to identify and avoid potential obstacles like wires, for the most part.THE BAD:First off, this is a minor thing but it really disappoints me: the Roborock doesn't leave nice clean vacuum lines in my carpet like my Roomba does.  When I come downstairs in the morning I can't tell if the vacuum has run or not without checking the app.  By contrast, the Roomba always left the carpet looking more freshly vacuumed.Second, the suction power seems fairly weak, even on the max setting.  Sometimes I'll find crumbs on the floor (even the hardwood floor) even after doing a vacuum and mop cycle.  I'm hopeful that I may be able to address this myself by changing the filter more frequently, or having it make more passes each run, or using the ""Max+"" setting (which temporarily disables mopping and uses full power for vacuuming).

Keiko;"Roborock's tagline of ""Forget about cleaning, really"" is very true with the S8";Color: Black;Verified Purchase;May 5, 2023;United States;"
I own a 2nd or 3rd generation Roomba, but with 2 cats and 2 huskies, it just wasn't cutting it anymore. The upgrade to the s8 is like a whole other level of cleaning. I should have done a before and after picture. The difference is that astounding. Let me start with the #1 reason I got the s8: NO CAMERASome people may consider this a negative, but as someone who works in the technology sector, I can't warn people enough. BE CAREFUL WHO GETS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. In this case, I didn't want pictures of the inside of my house going to the internet. (Have you seen the story of the woman who had pictures of her on the toilet sent to the internet by her robot vacuum? That [or worse] can happen to you too.) The s8 uses a lidar system that I dare say is the most accurate at mapping and avoiding obstacles that I've seen. BRAVO and KUDOS to Roborock for using this mapping solution instead of a camera and taking steps to protect my privacy. The ENTIRE tech industry needs to start trending this way. (Yes, I understand the irony of saying this on Amazon.)I watched it as I sent it on it's first mapping run of the house and then as it started it's first real cleaning job. The app interface is incredibly accurate. It showed me what the s8 could see and also showed me where the s8 actually went, tracing it's path with a white line and marking obstacles accurately. In fact, I noticed that the s8 had avoided a spot that had no obstacles, so I checked the app and saw a little cat face icon, letting me know that it was avoiding the fur baby and would get that spot on another pass later. Incredible! And other things I didn't think it would recognize, it popped up an accurate icon for (such as a bar stool and even a pet bed and kennel!)Mopping is completely hands free with Pro Ultra Rock Dock. You only need 1 a cap full of the cleaning solution per each fill up of the clean water tank. I ran the s8 at full intensity 4-5 times from evening to overnight via scheduling (I was really breaking it in) and in the morning I woke to find a pop up letting me know to empty the dirty water tank and fill up the solution. The dock also cleans the mop for me as well as air-dries the pad to prevent mold.As far as noise, the noisiest part of the entire experience is the 10-15 seconds the dock empties the s8's dust bin. Other than that, the s8 is so quiet even at MAX+ power, I was concerned that it wasn't operating at 100% (compared to the extremely noisy Roomba I previously had.) On quiet modes, the s8 is so quiet, you may not know where it is without looking at the app.There's so much more I could say, but I've gone on long enough. If I had to come up with a negative, I'll say that there are so many features and settings available in the app, it can get overwhelming to non-techie folks. Oh and for those of us who are techies - one negative is that if you're the type of person who keeps your data secure, the app has a hard time if your phone or tablet is connected to a VPN. You'll have to disable it for the first time connection.Other than that, I don't know what else to say. Want to not have to think about cleaning? Get the roborock S8 Pro Ultra

Alex;Best robot vacuum by far!;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;March 8, 2024;United States;"
I've owned multiple Ecovac robot vacuums, and I finally had enough of their issues to try something new. So far, I'm extremely happy with the Roborock. The vacuum is way more intelligent. It doesn't get stuck at all like the Ecovac I had, which would go haywire and back into everything. The Roborock also has many settings you can tweak to fit your life and house. I have a mix of carpet and hard floors and even the actual cleaning function has been hands down better than my previous vacuums. The big test will be to see how the longevity of the dock and vacuum hold up over the next year. However, after a solid 3-4 weeks of vacuum cleaning daily, everything has been working great. I've also not had any issues with the map freaking out and disappearing or creating a new one. I had this problem every other day with the Ecovac and had to go through, delete the map, and have it start all over. It was really interesting as well to see how the Roborock can identify objects correctly; for example, it showed on the map that it had detected an actual shoe that one of my kids had left out.

This machine is an awesome mopping and sweeping machine.  You can control the suction power in different rooms, set different floor materials, and much more.  It has been a lifesaver for me.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because there are some downsides.  1.  In order to work the machine with the app on your phone, you have to have 2.4ghz internet, meaning your 5G has to be split.  That took some doing.  It works perfectly now that it's split.  2.  The MAJOR issue for me has been trying to program the machine to clean rooms in a specific order.  For almost a month, I was emailing and calling Roborock DAILY, trying to figure out why I can't program this machine to clean rooms in a specific order.  For the first 2 weeks or so, I was asked to send pics of the map of my home, told to do different things to make the app divide the rooms so the Sequence option would show up, etc.  For the next week or so, I was told that the machine can't be programed, and the Sequence option isn't available.  I can't tell you how many days of my life I've wasted trying to work this out.  The representatives obviously have no clue how this machine works.After spending many hours trying to figure this out, I finally got it.  You CAN program this machine to clean in a specific order.  If you set up zones on your map, the order in which you set the zones, is the order that the machine will clean in.  i.e.:  The first zone you set is the bathroom, 2nd bedroom, 3rd kitchen, 4th laundry, 5th den, etc.  The machine will clean the bathroom 1st, bedroom 2nd, kitchen 3td, laundry 4th, den 5th.  I hope this is helpful because it drove me nuts!

I had a cheaper robot for a couple of years just trying out the robot cleaning realm and then decided to upgrade since my place is all hardwood and could likely get a good cleaning with a robot. I was decided between this one and the ecovac deebot which are similar high end price ranges. Doing my research the round robot vacuums seemed to be able to get corners better than the square shape, which was surprising to me so I decided to go with the robovac. I have not only been surprised by how good and time saving this is but amazed in every aspect. The drying the mop really does take away any smell component. I’ve cleaned each piece and it’s super easy. I’ve had to contact support 1x because it was doing funny things and not being able to dock and they went above and beyond truly. Sent me videos and showed me how to send a report of what my robot was doing as well as step by step instructions on how to fix it which instantly worked. I am so happy with this product and have used it way more often than I thought. There’s truly no area left poorly cleaned and I’m so happy. Worth every penny.

I took a while to decide which robot to buy and I’m so happy we picked these one. Last robot we had was a Roomba and a Braava to mop and the braava was just so disappointing. Roomba was ok, but it’s miss spots here and there.The Roborock is so superior to those too combined. Our braava would only get the floor wet, but my perception is that it wasn’t heavy enough to actually clean. I have two messy kids who love “to cook” a dog and a cat, so moping is hard work here. I had my doubts but after reading so many great reviews I decided to splurge and get it. It MOPS!! it looks like when our cleaning lady does it 😁 I am beyond happy with the way our floors and carpets look. Also it’s our first robot with smart mapping, love that it can learn different maps. I know I’m a little late to the party, but I’m amazed. To be able to divide rooms, pick materials, the orientation of wood, etc. its great. Also our house is big and it takes waaay less than our Roomba used to. Buy it, you won’t regret it

I have had various other brands over the years and they all suffered from the same stupid software issues. Here are the things that I have noticed that the S8 does better than all the other ones I have tried…1) the mapping mode would just enter the room and look around. It didn’t have to cover every square inch like the others. So the full map only took a couple minutes. When it finished this, I asked my wife… did it even do it? So she showed me the map in the app. Omg, it was awesome.2) its auto breakdown of the rooms was not great but I was able to merge everything together and split at better locations. My wife struggled with this but it wasn’t bad and only needs to be done once. Compared to others, this was simple.3) it finds the walls and obstacles without running into them. My wife has had to paint the baseboards so many times over the years because the other brands would just constantly run into the walls. This one doesnt even run into a balloon on the floor. How cool.4) i had to pause and move it once. Other brands would be completely lost at that point and would not make it home. The S8, figured out where it was and picked up where it left off. Omg amazing.5) it is only one machine and would vacuum and mop on the same pass. Its hard to describe how much faster it is this way and it works well.6) it is so quiet compared to the other ones i had. Although I haven’t tried, i could probably do a conference calls while this is busy in the same room.Most of my house is tile with bedrooms carpet and we out a rug in the living room. Works well on all these. I was commenting to my wife that this is the first one I actually like. The others were noisy and irritating and she would have it run all day.

They say you get what you pay for, and it's never been more true for me than with this purchase. This is my 4th robot vacuum (2 Ecovacs and 1 Roomba previously), and this one far outshines its predecessors (it also was the most expensive). But it has been worth every single penny. I have two large dogs (a St. Bernard and a Golden Retriever), and they shed like it is their JOB! All previous models got the hair tangled up in the brushes/wheels (both), or the suction wasn't strong enough to empty the bag into the base (Ecovacs), or they didn't do a great job (both) - but this one has been phenomenal. It does an amazing job picking up all debris, dirt, and dog hair, and I've had no jams at all. The brushes detangle themselves, and the main multi-directional wheel is easy to remove, so if/when hair does build up there, I can just pop it out to clean (the Roomba had this, too; Ecovacs did not). The mopping feature works really, really well and I LOVE that it dries the mop head so no smelliness. My Ecovacs (supposedly) mopped, too, but it did such a poor job that I never used the feature. Plus, it had to run separately from the vacuum (attach mopping head). This one is all built-in and does an all-in-one. It actually ""lifts"" the mop head out of the way when it detects carpet. The app is great; scheduling is a breeze. It doesn't ""lose connection"" to my network constantly (looking at you, Roomba), and it displays a very accurate map, allowing me to see just what has been vacuumed/mopped. All-in-all, I couldn't be more pleased with this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants the best and is willing to pay the price for it. I would buy it again. No question.

It’s louder than I expected and talks a lot, announcing its actions lol but it cleans fantastically. I moved into an apartment with vinyl tile flooring and hadn’t yet mopped or vacuumed in 2 months. There were little bits of cardboard and tape from cutting moving boxes open and a few crumbs in the kitchen and some visible dust bunnies throughout the space. I ran it for the first time yesterday evening. It mapped the space well and got to work. It ran for a bit, announcing it was cleaning the mop 2 or 3 times but when it announced it was done and returning to the dock I was truly impressed. It collected everything. The main brushes jammed once but it was a breeze to remove the item and reinstall the brushes. The only thing I’m not wowed by is the Roborock app but I’m figuring it out. It was definitely a splurge that I’m still paying for but so far I’m delighted with it. This is my third robovac/mop and by far the most expensive one I’ve tried. Unlike others I’ve had, this one did everything itself. No installing a mop pad or cleaning it or guiding the robot around obstacles or picking it up to have it run over an area a second time… outside of clearing the jam I did nothing. They’ve engineered a really terrific machine here. Recommended—if it’s within your budget this is the one to get!

I've had an iRobot J6+ vacuum (the one with a camera specifically made to avoid pet poop) for a few years now and although I've been generally pleased with how the iRobot cleans, the robot's ability to navigate is simply horrible.  I've watched in amazement many times as it seemed to turn back and forth randomly as if completely confused.  Sometimes it comes out of the dock and immediately gives up trying to go to a room that is clearly on its map.  Crazy.The Roborock S8 Pro, which uses Lidar, maps the entire space in about 10 minutes and flawlessly moves around the house without hitting things continuously.  It still has trouble from time to time, but in general it operates so much more intelligently.  The app and capabilities are much more advanced as well.  Vacuuming is good - at least equivalent to the iRobot.  Mopping is decent, but the mop is not exactly as wet as I would like it to be.  If the floor is not flat, it can miss certain areas.All in all I'd certainly recommend this vac/mop combo

I have been using the roborock 8s pro for about 3 weeks.  Overall, it seems to mop & vacuum really well especially on the highest setting.  I have about 1300sf of polished Travertine and it is shiny after a mopping on high!  It makes really well with a minimum of adjustments to separate rooms and delineate where rugs are and no go zones.  ( I even did a no go zones around the Christmas tree skirt and it worked perfectly!  The only 2problems I have experienced is 1 major and 1 minor.  The minor is that it has a bit of a problem getting up into an area low pile rug in my LR but it does finally make it.  The MAJOR problem I have is that it is not self evacuating the dust bin.  I have been in contact with tech support regarding the problem.  They were very nice on the phone and then send you a bunch of pictures for you to compare how yours is set up and how it should be which was helpful but didn't fix the problem.  Apparently there is some magnet on the dust bin that is necessary and perhaps I don't have it.  That part was never made clear but they offered to exchange it for a new one.  I did ask if it was a refurbished unit and they said it would be new.  In the end I chose to return it thru Amazon as I felt I should stay protected by the return policy in case there was any warranty issues.  I'll adjust my post when I get and use the new one thru Amazon.

The S8 Ultra excels in several categories:1. Reliability: It doesn't get stuck or lost, with the Ecovac T8 as a close second. The iRobots often require placement on the dock at least once a week.2. App and Mapping: The S8 has the best app and mapping capabilities, with the iRobot coming in a distant second. The Ecovac T8 struggles with mapping as they get deleted randomly.3. Mopping: The S8 is the best mopping robot, while the iRobot J7+ combo falls way short in this aspect.4. Vacuuming: The S8 excels in all-round vacuuming, although the iRobots perform better on carpet, and the Ecovac T8 is slightly better on hard floors.5. Dock: The S8 boasts the best dock, whereas the Ecovac T8 has the worst.6. Navigation: The S8 has the best navigation, with the Ecovac T8 as a close second, while iRobot's navigation is subpar.7. Obstacle Avoidance: Surprisingly, the iRobot performs best in obstacle avoidance, but it tends to bump into walls and furniture. The S8 and Ecovac T8 rarely touch any obstacles.However, there was a disappointing incident when my S8 vacuum ran over a pet mess. After cleaning it thoroughly, it's back in action. But it’s frustrating my very expensive robot failed with the pet waist.Overall, the S8 remains the best robot in my collection, but I wish the liquid bins were larger as I have to fill/empty them every two cycles. Doubling their size would be ideal.

I was back and forth on spending so much money for a robot mop/vacuum and waited for the price to drop ( got it for $999) This thing is amazing. We’ve had no issues with it. If you’re on the fence like I was for 10 months pull the trigger. You will not regret it.

Jason Chamberlain;A very intelligent robot vacuum/mop;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;August 30, 2023;United States;"
I have been a Roomba user for many years, and still own 2 but my Roomba S9+ has become increasingly unreliable with software updates, so I moved it to a less challenging floor and purchased the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra+ for my main 1000 sq. ft. floor after reading many reviews. So far (11 days and about 10 cleaning runs in) so good. This is by far the most intelligent robot cleaner I have ever had, and it's almost spooky in action.To begin with, its mapping feature is excellent (far superior to my best Roomba)! One run on fast mapping, and it had all the rooms (7) correctly laid out. It correctly identifies bare floors (and wet mops them) and carpets where it increases  the vacuum power and retracts the mop. If I didn't watch it in action, I might not have believed it could really do that. So I can send it into a room with bare floors with throw rugs with no problem.At the beginning and end of a run it cleans the built in mop, sending dirty water to tank for that purpose, loading clean water into the robot, then it air-dries the mop. Lastly it sucks out dirt from the vacuum filter receptacle and starts the recharge process. It clearly announces it is going to do each of these steps (which fascinates my cat.) So...Pros: Hands free automated floor cleaning of varied surfaces (doesn't get stuck and it doesn't damage my oriental rugs, either)Cons: User interface for initially customizing the map is difficult to use;  User interface for setting up selective cleaning jobs (this room or that room kind of thing) is also a little unfriendly - takes some fooling around to get those straight; Oddly doesn't warn you when your fresh water tank is empty.Other than that - GREAT product

Suzette Sneath;Much better than Top of line Roomba products;Color: White;Verified Purchase;September 9, 2023;United States;"
We have a pretty large house, so I needed two roomba i8 vaccums and 2 roomba m6 moppers to get the downstairs cleaned (without it taking 8 hours).One of my braava m6s stopped working, and it was less than 1 year old. Out of frustration, I decided to try a new product and purchased the Roborock s8 pro ultra. Originally I figured I would just use mopping feature and keep my roomba vaccums.I am so glad I switched to this s8pro ulta. The vacuuming is fantastic, and the mopping capability is far superior to braava.So many features that make this a way better product that I didn’t even think about before.The fact that I don’t have to change the mopping pad everytime is so nice!With a separate vacuums and mopper system you have to let the machines run almost all day so each one finishes their job before the next one starts. Way better and more efficient to have one machine do one pass throughout the home and handle both vacuuming and mopping.The s8pro ultra is actually more quiet than the roomba too which is really nice.I think the most important feature for me so far is that Roborock can ran at night while everyone is sleeping. Roomba would never run at night as it needed light and that was a huge downfall. Roborock did wonderful last night in the dark!I know this price tag is a lot, but I wish I would have purchased this in the beginning as I would have saved money in comparison to roomba products.The mapping feature in Roborock is way better and takes no time at all!I was also worried about my rugs getting wet with the mopper system. We have really expensive and thick rugs throughout the house.One thing I didn’t realize about the Roborock until after I purchased it was it has the ability to start and go right to vacuuming the rugs first, then it will do mopping afterwards so you don’t have to worry about that.I did check to see if any rugs were damp or wet after switching from hard floor to rugs and nothing! Our rugs are about 1/2 inch thick, so again I was extremely impressed.I absolutely love this machine and highly recommend this to anyone looking or on the fence about what product to purchase.I hope it continues to perform as well as it has in the last 24 hours.Hoping they come out with a robot to do laundry next! 🤣

I saw the prices for the Roborocks and balked.  I couldn't justify paying that, so I bought the other big name brand.At first it did a decent job, but it was never perfect.  Why?- It never finished a run.  It almost always got stuck somewhere and needed to be rescued.- Parts wore out faster than I would have liked.- It often thought the bin was full when it was just dirty.- The mop (separate unit) had to be cleaned every other time and cleaned every time.Finally the vacuum stopped emptying.  After looking online, I had to take the stupid thing apart and clean parts of it.  That helped for a while, but then one of the rollers jammed, it didn't know, broke, and started spinning in the broken mounting.  What happened?  It got so hot the plastic melted.  I can only imagine if I hadn't smelled it, the possibility of a fire would have pretty good.That was the last straw.  I bit the bullet and bought this beast.  After a week I learned that buying the other was a total waste of money.How is this better than the other guys?- Mapping is far superior.- Setup is easier- This never gets stuck- The mop actually cleans the floors (the other seemed like it pushed dirt around)- If this says the bin is full - the bin is full.- This goes places the other one wouldn't.- I have a GSD.  This has pulled up a SHOCKING amount of hair, I didn't even know was in the carpet.- This cleans much better.- This one is quieter when it runs and much quieter when it empties.- The other one would get lost and good luck finding it.  This one shows you on the map if you accidently shut it in the bathroom.- Real time tracking of the cleaning jobTime will tell if this holds up well, but so far it's miles and miles beyond the other big name robot vacuums.

Mark Busalachi;Best cleaning appliance ever purchased.;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;January 7, 2024;United States;"
Well I have to start out by saying, yes this beast is pricey however worth every penny!  I have owned the competition for several years but nothing compares to Roborock.  This is a well developed product that operates beyond expectations.  My carpets and floors are very well cleaned and I.have had not one issue with this robot.  I get the maintenance on it, because being an engineer of sorts, any product of this caliber need to be maintained thoroughly.  Regularly cleanings, tanks, cleaning brush and filters a must but really it only takes about 20 minutes to complete.  Usually once a week on a Sunday, I wipe it down completely, pull the brushes and rollers and clean the hair that builds up on the stems.  Other than that, cleaning the dirty water tank regularly keeps the unit from foul smells and buildup.  Would purchase again if new model immerges but very happy with this one.  Also would like to say, with any robot vacuum, you absolutely need to prep your home for the scheduled operation of this device.  Making sure no wires are left on the floor, if pets live there, make sure there is no droppings or vomit on your carpet or floors and just pick up anything that might be a hazard to your robot.  Other than that, would totallly recommend this product if affordable to you.

Love my Roborock s8!!! I have been watching it since it was released and wanted to wait until there were a bit more reviews before making this investment. I purchased around the holidays so it was discounted down to 1199. Now that I own it this smart device I would have definitely paid full price. Its such a time saver and it works great. I do walk around and make sure that things are picked up but it will notate things on the map if it finds things it doesn't expect. The mapping is so easy & it improves every time it runs. This saves me many many hours each week in vacuuming and mopping.I have hardwood floors and find it does a great job. I have 3 dogs and it manages the dog hair wonderfully. They are all short haired dogs, 2 are bulldogs & 1 shih tzu...This device is NOT going to scrub up dried bulldog slobber... so you will need to scrub that up. It can also get a little noisy so if you work from home you may not want this running during meetings. The nosiest part is the mop cleaning & sucking out the dirt. I have not used any cleaning solution and strictly use water and it works fine. The 1st run was streaky but each run after that was fine. If you are on the fence...its worth it!!!

briggs in MI;Works well for sweeping and light mopping.;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;October 8, 2023;United States;"
Works very well for sweeping and light mopping.  Floors look clean and dust free afterwards  The only issue I’ve run into after owning it for 4 months is I keep getting the message to “Check for Air Duct blockages and empty the DustBin”.  When I look the Air Duct is blocked and the dustbin is full.  I empty and unclog them, but it just keeps happening again.  It happens at least every other sweeping and since it requires me to disconnect the power to the dock, turn it upside down, unscrew 3 screws to access and unblock the duct, while doing so, dust and debris are spread all over, negating the dust free, hyper allergenic disposal system.  This process is quite inconvenient, dirty and time consuming.  I have it set to vacuum twice a week, mopping one time, so I am doing this manual unblocking of the duct once a week.  Because of this, I’m still on my first dust/debris bag as it has actually gotten a little debris in it.  We only have 1 short hair cat, so we do have some pet hair, but not a ton of it.  If they could fix this issue, I would give this product 5 stars.  I’ve had 3 other irobot vacuums and this does the best job of keeping the floors clean.  This is my first auto empty, I just wish that feature actually worked.

We got this in thanksgiving deals and we've been using this for the past 3 months and so far have no concerns about the brand or the product. It's such a relief to have roborock; I'm literally in love with it as my personal helper. It may be easily handled from your phone and has a variety of choices, such as cleaning the entire house or just specific rooms. You may operate from anyplace, whether outside or indoors.  For the first time, roborock was able to accurately map the house and distinguish between carpet and hardwood flooring. Its biggest feature is that you don't have to clean it or something. You just have to fill and drain the clean and filthy water once every 3-4 days, depending on the area of the house and how regularly. It is worth the money . Just put somewhere where it can dock or undock easily itself.

I previously had a iRobot Roomba vacuum and it was awful. Made a ton of racket, stuck constantly, etc. It really made me hate robot vacuums. I work at home and have been really busy so the floors always get on my nerves. We have 2 cats and a dog and the floor just always seems dirty. It stressed me out. So, i started researching robot vacuums once more. i came across this one and looked at the listing probably 5 times over the course of two months. It was so expensive but the reviews were glowing. So I took the plunge and am I glad I did! This vacuum is magnificent! It has rarely gotten stuck mostly on my very odd metal coffee table, the transition from moping to vacuuming on rugs is A+, it's rarely sucked up anything it's not supposed to, mainly hoodie strings my cats like to drag from hiding places. The map and room/zone set up is a piece of cake. The app response is almost immediate. I truly cannot say enough amazing things about it. I do not use their cleaner but other plant based cleaners in the tank and there are 0 streaks on my floors. BUY IT. I swear it's worth it.

Sydney;Worth the $$;Color: White;Verified Purchase;September 4, 2023;United States;"
Let me start off by saying this was not an easy purchase decision for me. I have struggled to come to terms with spending this amount of money on a vacuum/mop, but it truly has increased my quality of life significantly. And that’s what money is for.I decided on this model because I did not want a camera going through my house based off of the reviews of the S7, so the S8 pro ultra it was. I also did not want a robovac that I had to manually switch the mop piece out, knowing that I would never do that. I read reviews for other robot vacuums and it sounds like all of them give out after about eight months so this felt like more of an investment.This brought me to Robbie the Roborock lol. This guy cleans to perfection. You think your house is clean until you empty the dirty water bin and realize you’ve been living in filth. I have a large dog who has short hair and Robbie the robot has no issue, slurping up all of his fur and any mud he brings inside. My dog typically goes after the vacuum, however he has no issue with Robbie especially once we did some desensitizing to it using lots of high-value treats.Outside of that my home has never looked cleaner, and I no longer feel embarrassed when friends come over and I start to notice little dust bunnies in the corners of rooms. You can tell when Robbie’s been working because the house shines and smells great.The only bad side of any vaccuum/mop machineThe dirty water basin does not smell good when you empty it, so I am going to try the recommendation online which is to buy a toilet bowl gel stamp for the top of it. We will see how that goes. I’ve only had to empty it twice, though.I’ve had Robbie for a few months now and could not be more thrilled about the purchase. Highly recommend.

We have cherry wood floors. Constant footprints from kids, if I didn’t have a robot mop, I’d go crazy. Why this insanely expensive robot mop? We tried multiple brands and even different roborocks, none of them are as impressive as this guy. The other mops leave streaks, the tank runs out of water before finishing my home (the s8 pro ultra goes back to the base and refills itself), one mop tried to mop my area rugs (this mop can tell the difference between floor and rug and it picks up its mop pad and vacuums the rugs). This mop can run 3-4 nights before having to empty the dirty water tank or fill the clean water tank. The other mops throw down a lot of water on my wood, while this mop throws it down and sucks it back up which is better for my wood and also likely why it doesn’t streak. I feel that it is more hygienic- this mop goes back to the base frequently and rinses the mop pad. It also picks the mop pad up off the base so that it can dry. Seems more hygienic than reusing a wet, dirty mop pad that has been sitting wet for a few days. Yes, I would buy it again. Do people judge me when they find out how much this thing cost me? Apparently so. Oh well, I have a new best friend. :)

Prior review: The instructions to setup the robot are terrible and my battery isn’t charging. On top of that, customer service sent me incorrect info on how to charge it, I had to do my own research after to realize they gave me the wrong info on a subsequent email. I haven’t received any further responses from the vendor and explained that a brand new product at this price point should be working. They’re indicating I can expect to hear back in 24 hours and they’d need to go through warranty now.Update: I ended up giving up with their product support, returning the product, and giving it another try. Their customer service may be ATROCIOUS but their product is top of the line. It’s night and day comparing to the roomba. It’s significantly smart to, less likely to hit your furniture, leaves your floors beautiful, and works very very well. The only thing that is annoying is you can’t silence the verbal descriptions as it goes through things: “washing the mop”, “starting manual run”, etcWould have gotten 5 stars if my initial interactions with customer service were not so bad.

Previously owned another brand for many years that finally needed to be replaced. Love the convenience of the Roborock Ultra Pro 8 that it self-empties & is always ready to go.

I have scheduled it for a daily vacuum, but can easily adjust as needed. I’ve owned it for a few weeks after purchasing it on Sale. Although expensive for my budget, it is very well worth it for how clean it is keeping my house with hardly any effort on my part. I’m very happy I purchased it & got it on sale, too! Note: Amazon did a very good job shipping! It arrived in an unmarked box over Roborock’s box & arrived as projected. It was helpful, too, how Amazon allows you to track even the hours which it will arrive & when it’s been delivered.

Cleaning Performance:While we have only had it a few days, our floors have never looked better! We have been using Bona on our new engineered hardwood floors for the past year and they always looked like they had a film on them and generally looked dull. Furthermore, after cleaning them with a lot of pressure, dirt would still rub off with a paper towel so they weren't really clean. After doing a deep clean mop using only water, the amount of dirt is astonishing and confirmed my suspicion that the bona was not really cleaning the floors.It also does an amazing job vacuuming the carpets and hardwood. We have a border collie that sheds a lot and it is great not having hair tumble weeds floating around and stuck in the carpet. And it has already saved us a bunch of time not having to pull out the upright and mop.Mapping & Obstacle Avoidance:We have a 4,400 sqft house with about 2,400 sqft downstairs and it only took about 30 minutes to map it with great accuracy. It is also great at avoiding obstacles and recognizing chairs, shoes, scales, etc.The App:The app is great, there are tons of features and configuration options and it is very easy to use. The ability to name rooms, create virtual walls and no-go zones is also very helpful as it did get caught up behind a toilet in our water closet due to a black rug bunching up.Only downside is that it does not like black rugs due to the cliff sensors so it will avoid them sometimes. However, after doing some research this affects all robot vacuums so it is not specific to this model or brand. As a result we decided to replace our black 8x11 shag rug in our great room with something lighter.Overall, this thing is amazing, while very expensive, I believe it is a great value as I can trust it to clean better than we were able to and is saving us multiple hours per week.

I have about 2700 sq ft of porcelain tile with just a few area rugs.  I've only had the S8 Pro Ultra make one vacuum and mop pass through the entire house and it's very impressive.  These are the things that stand out for me:1. Mapping is very precise.  After one false start I followed the instructions and opened all doors and let it do it's thing.  It created a single map of every room which I was then able to split up and label as separate rooms. From there setting up a detailed schedule was easy.2. It was easy to setup ""no go"" zones.  You start with a rectangle which you can stretch and rotate to the needed size then place on the map.  Add additional rectangles for complex shapes.  I have an U shaped couch (red outline in middle of picture) which required three of these rectangles but was easy to setup.3. I wanted to set up a cleaning zone in front of the food prep area of the kitchen (white object left of couch is the cooking island).  I only wanted to cover the area between the gas range and the cabinets behind it.  Cleaning zone creation is similar to ""no go"" zone setup with one major flaw.  You can resize and move the cleaning zones but you cannot rotate them. That required me to create multiple overlapping rectangles to cover the odd angles of the area.  I hope this works because after creating a ""routine"" using these zones I can't see them in the App anymore. I hope the App developers see this because these two changes would make a great product even better.4. Performance of the mop feature is outstanding.  My floors now feel ""squeaky clean"" again.5. I don't use Alexa for security reasons so won't be evaluating it.I'll update this review as I get more experience with the machine.6. Human engineering miss.  The fresh water tank lid must be held open during a refill making this an unnecessary two  hand operation. (see video)

Environment: approx 1700 sq/ft of luxury vinyl plank. Two adults, two kids, a large dog (mastiff breed), and I set it to ignore all the rugs (they’re Ruggables, so we toss them in the wash when they’re dirty).We’ve had it just under a week, and it’s been a noticeable game changer. It’s so nice not to have to manually clean the floors. This has already saved us hours of time, so as long as its durability matches its ease of use, this thing will absolutely pay for itself in time saved alone.We’ve tested all the settings and haven’t had to use anything higher than the “medium” settings (balanced vacuum, moderate mop, and standard route). On this setting, it definitely gets all the dog hair and paw prints, all the grass from outside, the crumbs by the table…everything. It mops up all the dried dog slobber. Truly, we’ve had no issues with the cleaning power so far.Quirks: it is determined to clean under the dining room table, even when all 8 chairs (total of 32 legs) are down. It would probably get stuck in there long enough for the battery to die if I hadn’t altered the map to avoid it. When the chairs are up, it effortlessly navigates the four table legs.Cons: the wheels leave tracks when it mops. Our floors are dark/multicolored (made to look like dark hardwood), and you have to look at the right angles w/ the sun coming in to see them, but you can absolutely see the wheel tracks after it mops. This doesn’t bother us one bit because it’s a small price to pay not to use the Bissell ourselves, but this may be a huge deal to some buyers.All in, this thing is awesome. We have schedules set, so we just make sure the kids pick up their toys and this thing does the rest. Really couldn’t ask for more

I purchased this unit, the series 8 after both my iRobot vacuum and separate mop died within a month of one another.  One has to question engineered obsolescence.....  Regardless, I chose this one because it was a mop/vacuum combo; however, I did have reservations regarding the ability to function well as both.  From the moment you pop the box open, you know it's a quality product, just in the way it is packaged with care and thoughtfulness.  The app is vastly more dynamic than the iRobot mop app I used previously.  I had the latest, greatest iRobot mop and vacuum, and it took several attempts and about 4 hours each time to map my home.  This mop/vacuum did it in about 10 minutes....it was a sight to see.  I have two dogs and live in the country, my home is one level and has about 1900 square feet of hard floors (luxury vinyl tile), and I despise dirty floors.  I love walking on a freshly mopped floor and not having particles stuck to my feet, and this does the trick.  If you're looking to get away from ever vacuuming and mopping again wholly, you'll need to wait a few years until we have fully functioning robots, but...if you love having a clean floor, daily, without particles of dirt, grime etc. sticking to your feet, this is for you.  We have large windows and get a lot of sun, so for us OCDer's the streaking is a little hard to look at.  When it gets to me, I run my sweeper mop/manual mop over the area a bit, however, this unit does a FAR better job at leaving fewer streaks than the iRobot mop did.  The app allows you to select a cleaning direction that aligns with the grain of your floor, having a much better-looking end result.  Overall, I am amazed by the technology of this Roborock S8 Pro Ultra, and I'd highly recommend it to everyone who loves a clean floor!

We have a multi story home with several styles of carpet, wood and tile. We also have several area rugs.  I spent a lot of time researching different robot vacuums. Other family members had purchased the shark and roomba robots all to pretty much stop using them in under a year. The combination of vacuum and mopping is what caused me to want to get the Roborock despite the dissatisfaction in competing brands on vacuuming only robots.After getting the robot we let it conquer each floor of the home. We learned quickly to get cords out of the way. A blind cord got wrapped in the Roborock as did thinner electrical cords. Spending a few minutes getting cords out of the way is worth the effort.  We also confirmed that the vacuum does not like high pile area rugs. We just created no-go zones in the app to avoid the issues in one of the rooms.The vacuum runs a lot longer than it would take to vacuum but it is also more thorough in most instances than I would be if I were vacuuming. It is able to go under the beds and other furniture that we would not always vacuum or mop.Sometimes it chooses what I think are unusual patterns but eventually covers the entire area. The maps in the app can confirm that it did or did not clean a particular area.I wouldn’t throw out your current vacuum though…. We still need to use the old one do the stairs and cover the area rugs that the Roborock cannot handle.In the end we have concluded that the signicant investment is worth it. It saves us time and we are able to keep the floors cleaner than we did before purchasing this vacuum/mop.

Elliott Lum;Like having a maid;Color: White;Verified Purchase;February 2, 2024;United States;"
A truly remarkable machine which dramatically outperforms the previous machines we’ve had from Neato and Samsung. What makes this machine so impressive is it’s ability to vacuum and mop and automatically adjust for carpets and floors. The mop even cleans  itself. Navigation around obstacles is excellent. Once your house is mapped, and the rooms identified the named you can selectively clean individual rooms using Alexa commands or the map on your smart phone. This was the top of the line machine when we bought it, but Roborock just announced several newer models at CES which will be available in April.We set the machine to automatically clean the house three times a week and feel like it’s almost like having a maid on our staff

It's expensive. However, it's worth the price. At our house, we're all either working full-time jobs or going to school. As a modern labor-saving device, I think it's worth it. The Roborock S8 exceeded my expectations. We have only been using it for about two weeks. It cleaned the floor better than I anticipated. We usually ditch the shoes at the front door. We can now easily walk around in warm socks or bare-footed and it's clean.Our floor is faux wood composite laminate. The Roborock did great with this floor, even getting the edges  at the baseboards with its little sweeper brush. It did struggle with rugs. We have a mixture of thin polyester rugs at the home entrances and higher-quality wool rugs inside the living areas. Roborock sucks up the cheap rugs and takes a minute to figure out the higher wool rugs. Once it got on the wool rugs, it did a good job. Going to buy double-stick tape for the thin rugs.It's smart. It went under the couch and found my missing flipflop. Reported it on the app. It also told on the dog when she investigated too closely. The setup was super easy. Get your home in order and hit the quick mapping function. Roborock did an admirable job of mapping the floor plan. It got confused by a mirror. It sees it as a ""closet"".

This thing is like a NASA invention that they decided to downgrade and just clean floors. It's so smart, I'm starting to suspect it knows more about my house than I do. I mean, it navigates around like it's got a PhD in vacuumology. It's picking up dirt I didn't even know existed – makes me wonder what I’ve been doing with my life. And the app? I can control this thing from my phone. It’s like I’m living in the future, except the future is just me not having to vacuum. It’s so quiet too, half the time I don’t even know it’s there. I could be talking to someone, and it just silently cleans around us, like a polite ghost who’s really into tidiness. Honestly, this vacuum doesn't just clean; it makes me feel like I've got my life together

I have two cats and two dogs, and while my house is generally very clean, my floor is the biggest challenge. Vacuuming is okay, mopping kills me. It should be done every day, sometimes twice, but who has the time? My husband always tells me I should hire someone, but, because I live in a touristy area, cleaning services charge tourist rates. And I just won’t pay that. I also refused to pay for some thing I can do myself for the most part. Enter this little genius robot. It vacuums and mops my house , and if I run a once a day, I don’t have to feel bad about anything. I don’t mind dusting, and my house is generally pretty damn clean and organized. And now my floors will be clean as well, every day! If I use this machine every day a  as I plan to, I will only have to to deep clean behind things periodically because this thing will keep even that mess at bay.It’s a huge leap of an investment, but I looked at what it would cost me to have someone clean my house, and what the payoff would be for this, and this is a bigger win. My floors have never been so clean. And because my house was generally organized, this is a win-win.I am in love this with this thing and unless it takes a crap I will continue to. If that day comes, I will reach out to the manufacturer. The manufacturer has decent customer service, as I did have a hiccup getting on my Internet, but they were helpful.

David hicks;Absolutely Amazing Robot;Color: Black;Verified Purchase;August 7, 2023;United States;"
This was my first Robot vacuum that I ever bought so I was a little leary considering the price but I wanted the best on the market and guess what...this is worth every penny !!! This robot is simply amazing I am shocked. It vacuums, mops, and I like to say sweep too because it vacuums my hardwood floors very well with it's vacuum and its little brush that gets in the corners and crevices for any dirt and crumbs. It also does an amazing job vacuuming my plush carpeting around my house as well...you can even see its vacuuming marks in the carpet after its done. And love how clean it mops my wooden floors too. Incase anybody is wondering Roborock sells special cleaning detergent for the mop water for this (you can't use regular floor detergent) which works great and is super concentrated so the bottle lasts a very longtime. This robot cleans, empty's, and drys itself after cleaning too so the maintenance its very minimum. Its app and map features and functions are topnotch too and very easy to use and function. This robot's navigation is also topnotch and even recognizes and identifies obstacles or items and marks them on the map for you as well. It drives around my house and obstacles with ease like it has eyes and a brain it's crazy lol !!! I absolutely love this robot and it has made my cleaning chores a breeze now lol !!! Everything that this robot does and offers is top tier and it's no wonder why it's been highly reviewed by many sites and other customer reviews. Buy this now because you won't regret it. This does it all and it does it very well !!!

I do really like the Roborock. We have hard floors, and some rugs. After it’s vacuums it’s spotless, I love seeing the vacuum lines on the rug, just makes me feel it’s extra clean. And it does a good job when mopping too. This is exactly why we bought it…. We have 2 young children so post dinner the floor is covered. The kitchen is the other area that just gets a bit grubby on the floor, from prepping dinner to wiping the surfaces down. Roborock takes care of it. So they’re the pros.I didn’t give it 5 stars for a few reasons:- it does get stuck more than I would like (bumps into a door and closes herself into a room)- I have to pick up a rug that has “tassels” on each end because when she runs over the tassles whilst vacuuming it gets jammed- quite noisy- maintenance is a pain- consumables are expensive (I didn’t take that into account when buying)

So long term iRobot user most recently with a J7 with the camera.  Decent device but it clogged frequently and required very frequent charging contact cleaning to charge at all.This new Roborock device is amazing. First it maps the entire floor with the LIDAR in like 10 minutes. The Roomba took hours and multiple runs to do the same.  The Roborock always seems to know instantly where it is in the house if picked up and/o moved to a new floor.The vacuuming works good and the mopping feature is amazing. Super amazing! Such clean floors.Worth the $1600!

We had an old Roborock S5 and had been very happy with it but wanted an upgrade that could do mopping and vacuuming in the same run without getting our rugs wet. We tried another manufacturers brand new flagship model which touted the same or possibly more advanced features than this one. We were so unhappy with it that we had to send it back after 3 weeks of shear frustration.We just set up our new S8 Pro Ultra yesterday, it mapped our home in about 4 minutes and flawlessly did a full cleaning with vacuum and mopping.Notables:1. The WiFi setup was a bit of a pain. I had to set my dual band router to only 2.4ghz and had to also turn off cellular on my cell phone before I could get it to work.2. The Roborock vacuum/mopping pattern goes back and forth in straight parallel lines which we like a lot. Not all robot vacuums will do this and you don’t really hear much about that.3. In order to have full functionality in the app you have to log into it with the owner account and shared access will not allow you to access schedules and perhaps other functions.

With 2 cats and a German Shepherd, the hair alone is enough to make one crazy, let alone in the fall with tracking in leaves and dirt from outside.  My job chains me to my desk for 9-10 hours a day. I don't have time to clean like I want.  This vacuum / mop is a game changer.  When I received it, I went ahead and used the old vacuum to give the new one something decent to start with.  I scheduled it for a full clean (vac and mop) every day.  It took a couple of cleans after mapping for it to learn the lay of the house well enough that it is now completely efficient in how it cleans.  It is leaving the house so fresh every day that I wonder how I did without it.  This is my first so I can't compare to other models but I absolutely love it.

I found this because the S7 had a great prime day deal. Though it was $700 more, the design and difference in cleaning urged me to buy this model instead (since we have pets). I’m blown away with how much better it performs than the iRobot or Shark models I’ve had. The mopping feature is decent, but not capable of cleaning anything more than small spills (anything that’s dry will need to be mopped the old fashioned way). Still, my house has never been cleaner.

So I've had many other robot vacuums in the past, from the old room and, to a top of the line Samsung, and our last one was the Ecovacs T8 AIVI.  Each was an incremental upgrade, with its own issues.My Ecovacs died after 2 years of daily use.  The Asurion warranty paid out the full purchase price, so I was in the market for a new robot vacuum.After doing a lot of research, I decided to wait until the Roborock S8 Pro came out, due to its unique features and aesthetic.After having it for 2 weeks, I've come to the conclusion that it's the perfect vacuum (at least for our needs).The mopping feature is amazing, and I love that EVERYTHING about it us automated, from cleaning the mop, to drying it, and even lifting it up when it encounters carpet or a rug.I love that it has easy to fill/empty ""ean"" and ""dirty"" water tanks in the base.  They last about 2 days at a time.  The bag in the bade hadn't needed replacing yet (running daily for 2 weeks).The app is the best app I've used so far dor a robot vacuum.  The wifi connection was easy.  The mapping of the home was fast and accurate.  It was super easy to assign room boundaries, divide open areas into ""rooms"" (the Ecovacs app is terrible about this by comparison).I literally cannot find a single flaw in this product.  The first couple of days, it got stuck in a few odd places, but clearly the AI is intelligent, and it ""learned"" from its experiences, and hasn't gotten stuck since.I did buy an Asurion warranty, and theist two robot vacuums I've had died after a couple of years, and the warranty easily paid for itself.

I had been a loyal Roomba iRobot customer for 20+ years and believe I had their first robot vacuum through the j7, but when I purchased the Brava jet robot mop, I was extremely disappointed.  When I managed to get it to charge I was satisfied with the performance but that only happened maybe 4-5 times!  I called customer service and I even spent another $100 to get a new base and cord but the new one performed exactly the same -absolutely would Not stay plugged in to charge!  They lost me as a forever customer.  I switched to Roborock s8 Pro Ultra and am delighted with this combo vacuum and mop!  Both perform better than Roomba.  The price was high but I am delighted with vacuuming and mopping results!

This is the 3rd robot vacuum we've had in as many years. I tried a Roomba and a Shark previously. Granted, neither of those were vacuum/mop combos, but the Roborock vacuums and mops our entire main level in ONE charge, and takes less than an hour (about 1000 sqft). It does a phenomenal job of it, too. We've done a lot of yard work recently and have patches of dirt that turn into mud every morning, with two large, long-haired dogs that track all sorts of dirt and mud in regularly. Not only that but we have four indoor only cats. This thing, so far (two weeks in) cleans the floors much better than our last vacuums and if it continues to do this well, it will be worth every penny. It's been super easy to clean/change/fill the water tanks and I love that it uses dust bags, too! The app, the mapping system, and the vacuum in general all seem much smarter and more well-designed than both of the last ones. Our floors have never been cleaner and I love that I can carry it upstairs and have it clean a second floor as well!

So I wish I could give more than 5 stars. I have other robot vacuums that require constant attention or repair. Not this one. Keep it clean and it just does its job with no hassle and fuss. Gives you alerts and turns the dock light red when it’s in need or attention. I have 6 pets and run it nearly daily and it tackles everything. It has very powerful suction that keeps my carpets clean and floors mopped perfectly. I use about a bag a month and only use my big vacuum every couple of weeks just to make sure everything gets picked up.  The lidar is so much more efficient at mapping and avoiding obstacles.  Smart home integration is seamless and the app is very user friendly.Not everything is perfect so some livable annoyances are the mop cleaning is a bit messy at times. You need to really use their cleaner to avoid an excess of suds. It’s set to vacuum carpet first then mop and sometimes after it starts it will drag the wet mop into the carpet. Not a big deal since it’s just damp, but still annoying.All said and done, when it’s time to replace the other two, which are a different brand, I will be looking to get another Roborock.

I’m a gadget guy,  so a robot vacuum/mop is something I’ve  been looking at for a few years now. My wife is taking care of her mother across town and is only home a few hours per week at most.  So I purchased the Roborock S8 Pro ultra to help me out with the house work.  I am very impressed with its prowess navigating around dining room chair legs, mopping skills and the S8 gets high marks vacuuming our hard wood floors and carpeted areas of the house.  I’m very satisfied with this product.  My wife remarked, “The floors look really nice,” on her first visit home after my purchase.

I have a multistory house and this is the 3rd RoboRock I have purchased.  This is on the first floor where most of the hard surfaces are installed.  Got it setup out of the box and mapped the first floor. It’s programmed to start cleaning at midnight.  I wake up to freshly washed hard surface floors and vacuumed carpets.  This machine truly does it all and does it quietly and efficiently.  I didn’t think it would be possible for Roborock to improve but they did with this S8 Pro Ultra.  Love it and highly recommend the purchase.  Yes, it is pricey but after having it set up for a couple of weeks and working well, I can honestly tell you it is worthy the price.

I have had this for 2 weeks now. It is a lot quieter and smarter than my previous robot vacuum. It does an amazing job on the edges of my floors and is overall amazing.However, my dog and cat shed like crazy, and every day I have to manually empty the dustbin because it cannot be sucked out into the base. A quick visual inspection looks like the robot is designed to suck out the dust bin from the bottom rollers, which just isn't capable of removing the fur.But, it is not hard to remove the fur and the base still cleans the mop and replaces the water.I also like how easy it is to clean fur out of the rollers. It was well-designed for removing fur from its moving parts.
