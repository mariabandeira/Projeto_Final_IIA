If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.

I'm trying to get to the flavor of candy apples you get at Halloween when I make my rock candy.  This alone didn't do the trick.  Still searching for the right combination.

My wife tried to use this to add cherry flavoring to mixed drinks.  It did not work for this application.
