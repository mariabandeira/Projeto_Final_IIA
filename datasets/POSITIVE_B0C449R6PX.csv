love these nutella cookies! crunchy, not too sweet and the nutella is soft but not drippy. the only problem is that the cookies tend to arrive mostly broken. they need some bubble wrap or something to cushion them during delivery. amazon ships them with any other stuff you order, and if you happen to have heavy items in your delivery, the cookies get crushed.

I I didn't even know these existed. Somehow I accidentally ordered four bags. And I'm so glad I did! Freshly Incredible! Surprisingly big in size. A nice crunch, then Nutella richness ozzing from the cookie. Wow, a great value. OMG the best! Shhhh our secret!

I first tried these in Mexico last year (2023) & absolutely fell in love. The taste and texture is fantastic!  I came across them here & was excited to try them again.  They were just as delicious as the ones I got in Mexico EXCEPT‚Ä¶.many were broken into crumbs. The Amazon shipping process just isn‚Äôt conducive to shipping a delicate cookie in a bag & have it arrive in satisfactory condition.I didn‚Äôt take off any points for that because it‚Äôs not reflective of the actual product.I hope this review helps

The biscuits are perfect for the whole family. They make a great treat to go in lunches or as a snack while studying,  at work, at the park, or  really any time. There is a good amount of biscuits in the bag and they are a decent size. Most of them came intact in the bag. They are great with coffee, Chai new, hot cocoa, or with cold milk of any type. Each cookie has 1 gram of protein in each, only has 5 grams of sugar and 70 calories per cookie. Delicious and not over the top with sweetness. These do contain wheat so they are not gluten free, if you or someone was looking for that option.

I love Nutella and the combination of Nutella with a biscuit like cookie is perfect. Not perfect is the way too many broken cookies in each bag. I could never plan on serving these to company unless I bought 3-4 times as many bags as needed ‚Ä¶ which I won‚Äôt do. Lost one star due to high number of broken pieces. Would have lost more than one star but the taste is so good, I feel generous about rating it.

The cookies arrived in good shape, all in tact.  Some reviews made me think they may arrive as a bag of crumbs, but this was not the case for me.  They are a shortbread cookie type of base with a creamy ganache-like center.  They are really good, nice textured cookie and nice textured filling.  I‚Äôm glad I found these, as I will be buying them again.  Would recommend.

We are definitely a Nutella fam, so when I saw these, I had to order them for my son!! The first time I ordered them, I wanted to try one before I gave them to him, and accidentally ate the whole bag over a single day of him being at school and me being off work.To make it up to him, I ordered them again-this time for his Easter basket-and while I was building his Easter basket, I just couldn‚Äôt resist, so I took them out and kept it for me.They literally have never even made it into my snack cabinet-they are on my nightstand in my room!!! Between the amount of these I will end up buying-as well as my monthly gym membership to maintain the body I had before discovering these-I‚Äôm sure at some point I may have to control myself, but for now, I will keep ordering these weekly and maybe one day let my kid try one.

My five-year-old granddaughter just tried hazelnut and chocolate combination.  This little girl has found her favorite flavor.  So, we have been trying all kinds of hazelnut and chocolate treats.  Because you can do that at Grandma's house.  She really like these cookies.  It did take her about 5 days to finish the bag.  She wouldn't share with anyone.  I had to stop her from eating them in one day.  She has asked for me to order them again.  I did look for them in the big box stores and could not find them.

I am going to start off by saying I am not a huge Nutella fan. I have always found it to be way too sweet, and it's not something you generally go light on. I decided to give these cookies a try and they were reasonably priced, so why not. If I didn't like them, I'm sure someone else in the house would. I have to say, that these are delicious! They have a really nice shortbread with a buttery taste and crunchy texture, and the center is filled with the right amount of Nutella. This is the perfect balance- just enough Nutella to complement the crisp shortbread. This is a way I can begin to like Nutella!
