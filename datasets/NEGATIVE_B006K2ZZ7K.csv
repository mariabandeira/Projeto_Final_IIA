The taffy arrived in one big lump. The wax wrapping was melted and the taffy all stuck together, seeping out of the wrappers. Unfortunately, I'm not able to comment on the taste because I tossed the entire 5 lbs in the garbage. I would also like to mention, I didn't order this during the summer months, it was early Spring and the weather was still cool. This item was a waste of money.

Soft taffy in a large variety of flavors. However, the taffy often sticks to the paper, the flavors are a little weak and underwhelming (could be stronger), and there is no pictorial key to tell you what the flavors are so I have been disgusted several times when I've chewed down on a coffee or nutty flavor that I thought would be chocolate. I now avoid all the brown ones.

Lewis;Good taffy but sticks to wrapper;0;Verified Purchase;April 17, 2013;United States;"
The taffy was received on time and in good condition. My family likes the taste but unlike previous salt water taffy we purchased at Atlantic City and Myrtle Beach, this taffy sitcks too the wrapping paper and you have to scrape it off and it never completely comes off the paper. Taste and texture is fine but difficult to unwrap and not worth the effort when I can buy it elsewhere without wrapper problems

I opened the box and the salt water taffy bag was tore open and there was salt water taffy everywhere.  The taffy was sent with other items in the box which made the taffy unsanitary.  The taffy was also very hard!!!

Claire M;I did enjoy some of the flavors so they get two stars;0;Verified Purchase;June 21, 2017;United States;"
Lots of the candy arrived poorly wrapped and thus lots were stuck together...some of the flavors were grossly chemical. Others were just gross. I did enjoy some of the flavors so they get two stars. I got this to supplement a gift to my father who loves salt water taffy...of course I had to do a taste test...I hope he likes them better than I did

Hard as a rock. Tried the ""soften it in the mouth trick""- too sticky.  Tried the microwave thing, too gooey and then even harder.  Had to pitch.

Absolutely terrible. Does not taste like saltwater taffy. Tastes fake and the texture is not at all that of salt water taffy.
