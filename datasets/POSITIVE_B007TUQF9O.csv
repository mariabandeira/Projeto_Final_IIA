Bigmama2114;I love these;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;April 23, 2024;United States;"
These seem to be extremely sturdy and well made. Unlike the cheap plastic type it appears that it will perform for a long time. The handle is sturdy and doesn’t bend under weight.The different sizes offer versatility. One would work for tea, one is a great size for draining a regular size can of vegetables.They are lightweight and the handle is easy to grip while straining a pot of boiled potatoes.

Update on previous review: I did contact Cuisinart after remembering they had a Lifetime Warrsnty on their products and their state-side customer service was very helpful and will be sending me a free replacement. I’ve updated my rating to 5 stars hoping this was a one off defect.Quality of stainless steel and wire mesh seems good however, the handle is not securely attached to the screen and separated after 3 months use (after return period).

SwansonFineArts;Great set;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;January 20, 2024;United States;"
Great set of mesh strainers.***Pros***This set contains three (3) sizes of mesh strainer. The smallest one is perfect for sifting powders like powdered sugar, adding a dusting of cornstarch to french fries, or other small applications. I haven't personally used the middle one very much, but it is useful. And the biggest one I use to rinse beans such as split peas for soup or garbanzo beans for making hummice. Overall I would recommend this set. They are easy to use, easy to clean, and overall a good purchase.**Cons***It would be nice if the set had insulated handles for dealing with hot items, but a pot holder works fine.

I’m glad I got, and find they’re very sturdy. I use them for stews and gravies that require removing the meat to continue cooking. The different sizes come in really handy for different pots and different ingredients. The one issue I have is that the mesh is somewhat fine, and these strainers can hold on to liquids if they’re thicker or just caught in smaller bits of food, so it can drain slowly. Overall, they really do make things easier for me, but I may also see if I can find some with slightly larger holes.

These are fine and seem sturdy enough - but the small one is useless for anything but a tea strainer, and the largest one isn't big enough for my largest needs, so I had to stick the tiny one in the drawer with other tea strainers, and buy a large one.To be fair, the sizes are listed, but it just seems like these (and an ever-increasing number of items on amazon) are photographed to appear larger than they actually are.  Maybe it's just me - but do check the sizes so you aren't surprised.

Sloane Schrodinger;23 mesh set of strainers, good quality, fine mesh;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;March 8, 2022;United States;"
Good set of strainers, single layer stainless steel mesh is 23 openings per inch. This is very fine, though not near as fine as a tea strainer I have that is 47 mesh. Sizes shown in listing are outside rim diameters. Actual strainer diameters are 2-1/2, 4-3/4 and 7 inches. Smallest size is little for a coffee cup. Strainers are bowl shaped. Mesh is crimped into polished rim and seems sturdy and doesn't leave a gap for food particles to get stuck into.  Spot welding on handles looks strong and didn't break when I applied pressure. Handles are a good size with thicker wire on the larger two.  I got these to replace a 20-year old one I have that is on its last leg.  Photos compare Norpro and the old one I have with the Cuisinart.Overall, nice set of fine mesh strainers, excellent value, I got all three for slightly more than the single Norpro. I don't see any major difference in quality between the two though I like the Norpro slightly better as it perfectly fits my coffee cup.June 2022 update: These look and work just as good as the day I got them. They are an excellent tool for the correct application. (The largest one is not a colander for a full load of wet pasta though it holds it fine so long as common sense is applied and the strainer is supported by both handles.) As far as cleaning, sure stuff can get stuck in the mesh, use an old tooth brush to clean or put in the dishwasher.  I haven't had any of the problems others have listed. Misapplication of any tool can do damage.  Use common sense and these will last a life time.

do not perceive me!;these are good for actual straining;Pattern Name: Strainers;Verified Purchase;December 16, 2023;United States;"
however, i am stupid and bought them for sifting flour, a task for which they are totally unsuited. don't buy them if you too are a fool looking to sift flour. you can steam stuff very easily in them though.

Sturdier than what you see in most stores. Dishwasher safe.
