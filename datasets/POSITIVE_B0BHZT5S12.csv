Ace Knight;I Keep Buying Kindle Tablets!  Incredibly Versatile!;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;March 14, 2024;United States;"
I have a herd of Kindle Fire Tablets from over the years.  I think I buy at least one new one every 2 years, if not yearly.  The price is right, especially during Prime Day or Black Friday sales, so why not?  The ""old"" ones then become upgrades for my parent's tablets -- or they get used as a touch-screen interface to a music system or home automation system, or they upgrade the *really* old ones that eventually become too slow or are no longer supported.  I have a few tablets I designate for use when I'm outside grilling or partying and don't mind getting beat up a bit.These 10in tablets are a nice size for when you want a bigger screen.  We've used them on Zoom calls with relatives and it's nice not having to listen to the noise of a laptop fan spinning up and down while video conferencing.  I've used them with some cloud gaming services and once again, it's awesome not having to hear a fan like you usually would when playing games on a laptop or PC.  I've also used these tablets to connect remotely to my desktop.  Paired with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard you can essentially use the tablet as a ""thin client"" to connect to a more powerful PC and the battery lasts a lot longer than a normal laptop battery would.  I've used some drawing applications on them too, where even if you just use your finger and pinch-zoom to magnify, you can actually create some pretty nice drawings if you're artistic.The world of apps and usefulness of Kindle tablets really opens up if you side-load Google Play Store.  I like Tinycam for viewing wireless pet cameras, SuperDisplay and EasyCanvas for a lag free display for Windows, Squeezer for remote control of Squeezebox music system, Pinball Arcade for pretty authentic pinball experience, Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to Windows desktops, NoMachine to connect to Mac Mini lag free, Steam Link & a bluetooth Xbox controller to remote play games from my desktop, Touch Portal (powerful remote macro control deck like Steam Deck), Sketchbook for intuitive drawing, Squid for note taking and brainstorming ideas, SimpleMind for quick mind maps, Engross for todo lists, Habits for easy habit tracking, MyRadar for viewing live weather radar & the list goes on!  Again, only after installing Play Store do you open up that world of possibilities, otherwise you are limited to what's on the Amazon App Store.  If you're a bit technical it's not hard to figure out.My wife and I love our Kindle Tablets and this 10in tablet is was the newest member of the group.  We've had very few issues with any of the tablets we've bought over the years, aside from some of the normal things that happen after you've installed dozens and dozens of apps and at some point have to wipe the tablet to clear it out and speed it up.  But no hardware issues to speak of really.  They've just ""worked"" and have been pretty rock-solid.  Unless they become more expensive, or quality changes, we'll continue buying Kindle tablets in the future.

I really like this tablet, the size is great, it's not to small or to big. Easy to hold, Great screen display. Awesome deal through amazon pay plan very low payments. Fast delivery with prime. Good battery life which is a must for devices these days. Only thing I dislike about that you cant download some apps, but its not a deal breaker. You can just use a different device or your phone for that reason. Unless one day amazon fire tablet miraculously gives us that luxury lol. Also I'm not sure if there's another way to do so. Get you one !!!

This is a replacement for a Fire tablet I bought about five years ago. I don’t know how, but the older tablet developed a dark area that made it difficult to read. This tablet was on the spring sale, so I purchased it and I’m happy I did!  This Fire is much more robust than the old one. Using it is almost like using my laptop. I was on the phone today with a friend and we were both searching for something on the internet. She was using her I-pod and I was using my. Fire. I.was getting results faster than she was and we both have the same thing internet provider and type of connection. I don’t use a lot of different apps, but there are certainly many available. I have downloaded books and taken it with me when I know I’ll be waiting. It’s easy to hold and read and there is a large library available. I frequently download audiobooks from my local library and listen to them when I’m doing things around the house.  This was a great purchase

I got this for Christmas.  When I downloaded new games, I got a lot of ads.  The ads became constant to the point they were even interrupting my reading.  I contacted the tech support and they were unable to help me.  In fact, one person became so frustrated that they hung up on me.  I finally did a chat call with someone who wasn't able to get rid of the ads, but was able to wipe my tablet clean.  I was then able to reload my books.  I do not play games on my tablet, I only use it for the purpose of reading.  I don't want to be bothered with the ads.  Nor do I want to pay to have the ads removed.  Otherwise this tablet works well.

kflaming;Employee kudos + the secret to 15W charging!;Digital Storage Capacity: 64 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 4, 2024;United States;"
Someone at Amazon deserves many kudos for getting this Fire HD 10 13th generation (2023 release) tablet to me before I left for Guatemala in the early morning hours of Thursday, February 8th. A few days before my trip, I went to download content on my Fire HD10 9th generation (2019 release) tablet but it would not start. I disassembled it and found the battery fully charged but the power distribution chip was toast! Finding no way to get it repaired locally, I ordered another one February 6th which, before I added it to my cart and before I completed my purchase, was promised overnight shipping. The new tablet was to arrive Wednesday, February 7th by 11am. After completing my purchase I noticed this had been changed to just sometime on February 7th. I looked at my orders around 3:30 pm February 7th and discovered arrival was now February 9th! I called customer service, gave them the what for, was transferred to Amazon shipping, gave them the what for also, even offered to drive down to the distribution center and pick it up myself! I was left with little hope of getting my new tablet before my trip. Then at 9 pm, a knock at my door, someone had come through!The Fire HD 10 13th generation (2023 release) has a vastly different x:y dimension than the 9th generation (2019 release). I had to order a new case but I like the new form factor better.The Fire HD 10 13th  (2023 release) collects a lot more dirt in the groove between its glass front and plastic backing than did either my HD 10 9th generation (2019 release) or my HDX 7 before it. I'm constantly trying to get it out with my thumbnails!The power button is in the wrong place on the 13th generation (2023 release). 9 times out of 10 when I go to turn up the volume, I end up turning it off!""Do what you love, uninterrupted""...but only if you can find the secret to recharging faster than 5 to 9 hours! The Fire HD 10 13th generation says it's native Amazon 9W charger, depending on starting battery level, takes ~5 hours to fully recharge. That's way too long to wait if you're wanting to use your tablet! Read on and I'll tell you how to access 15W USB-C charging that only takes ~2 hours!I read Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports are capable of up to 15W charging. I did not want to buy a 15W charger (fire hazard) from one of the many 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offering them here on Amazon. I have other charges from a prominent brand here on Amazon, some claiming PD 3.0, offering up to 5V4.8A, and rated up to 60W, that were taking anywhere from 5 to 9 hours. Why didn't these work? What's the secret to 15W Charging?Well, I found it! Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports, at least the 13th generation (2023 release) HD 10, use the PD PPS protocol to negotiate 15W charging. But why didn't my existing name brand chargers provide 15W? There's more detail on that below.You need a charger with PD 3.0 PPS or PD 3.1 (that's guaranteed to have PPS) to get 15W charging. If a manufacturer claims PD 3.0 but fails to mention PPS in the product description, use the ""Looking for specific info?"" box to ""Search in reviews, Q&A..."" for ""PPS"". You need at least 3A in whatever PD PPS voltage output range contains 5V.Details:The Fire HD 10 uses an order of precedence when negotiating a charging solution with a charger, first attempting PD negotiation then ultimately dropping back to basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. Basic USB Type C charging power drops off dramatically during charging leading to 5 to 9 hour charging times whereas PD PPS power stays fairly close to 15W the entire time. 15W PD PPS charging should really only take ~2 hours from ~10% to full or you've been taken!Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies are offering 5V3A 15W USB-A chargers using a USB-A to USB-C cable with integrated 56 ohm resistor to emulate a USB-C to USB-C cable. Sorry, these may be able to provide the requisite 15W but USB PD is just not available from a USB-A charger port. Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offer 5V3A 15W USB-C chargers using USB-C to USB-C cables that don't offer USB PD protocol. I have a handful of older chargers of these types from a reputable charger manufacturer and one does provide more power initially (11.5W) than the native 9W Amazon charger but basic USB Type C charging starts at lower power than true USB PD charging and drops off rapidly. I've seen the Fire HD 10 reported anywhere from 5 to 9 hours until fully charged for these basic USB Type C chargers.USB Power Delivery (PD) 1.0 was released July, 2012. With the USB PD 1.0 you get six fixed power profiles for different device categories 5V2A, 12V1.5A, 12V3A, 12V5A, 20V,3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 2.0 fast charging standard was released August, 2014. With the USB PD 2.0, you got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 3.0 fast-charging standard was released November, 2015. USB PD 3.0 made functional improvements but did not present (voltage) differences compared to USB PD 2.0, you still got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 3.0 PPS fast-charging standard was released February, 2017. This version adds a programmable power supply (PPS) that can realize voltage and current regulation using USB PD protocol output. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages, USB PD 3.0 PPS has specific PPS voltages, which are 3.3V-5.9V 3A, 3.3-11V 3A, 3.3-16V 3A, and 3.3-21V 3A, 3.3-21V 5A (100W Max).The USB Power Delivery 3.1 fast-charging standard was released May, 2021. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages and USB PD 3.0 PPS programmable voltages, USB PD 3.1 adds 15V-28V 5A, 15V-36V 5A, and 15V-48V 5A (240W Max).From a prominent charger manufacturer's website:Power IQ 1.0: Supports 5V/2.4A maxPower IQ 2.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0Power IQ 3.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0Power IQ 4.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0 + Dynamic Power DistributionBecause of the way Power Delivery specifications were released, a manufacturer can legitimately claim PD 3.0 support without supporting PPS needed for 15W charging Amazon USB-C tablets.I have a 45W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 3.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ⎓ 2.4A / 9V ⎓ 3A / 15V ⎓ 3A / 20V ⎓ 2.25A.  I see the Fire HD 10 briefly (about 1 second) hit 12.4W while attempting PD negotiation before dropping back to 9W basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. The Fire HD 10 reports 5 hours until fully charged.I have another 60W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 2.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ⎓ 3A / 9V ⎓ 3A / 15V ⎓ 3A / 20V ⎓ 3A. My FNIRSI FNB58 says the Fire HD 10 negotiates PD 1.0 14W but it seems unable to decode the device categories used by PD 1.0. It makes no sense but the Fire HD 10 reported 2 hours until fully charged for this apparently non-PPS charger. BUT, this weird PD 1.0 negotiation doesn't always succeed and, when it doesn't, the Fire HD 10 drops back to 7W basic USB Type C charging reporting 7 hours to fully charge!I'm including pictures of the Fire HD 10 charging at 14.6W ""43% • 1h:31 min until full"" on a car charger (sorry, it was dark), the car charger supports PD3.0 36.00W PDO:4 where PDO:4 is 3.30-11.00V 3:00A, the PD3.0 45.00W PDO:4 charger that fails PD negotiation and drops back to 9W basic USB Type C charging, and the PD3.0 60W PDO:4 charger that sometimes negotiates PD 1.0 14W and other times drops back to 7W basic USB Type C charging.

George H. Seidel Jr.;Loved it, but the one I got was defective;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;April 18, 2024;United States;"
I loved this Kindle.  But after a few weeks it started glitching.  I would open a book to read it, and within a few seconds the book would disappear, the screen would go dark, and then a message would flash so fast that it was difficult for me to read.  After repeating this process dozens of times so that I could finally read the message, I was found that the Kindle was informing me that my (actually none of my books) were in my list.  The first time this happened, I reset the Kindle to factory defaults, and then re-downloaded my books.  But a week later the same thing happened again.  I figured I just go bad luck, so I wanted to ""replace"" the Kindle with an identical one.  But Amazon wouldn't let me do that.  I had to return it and get my money back.  I really don't have complaints about the Kindle; every once in a while you will get a product that doesn't work.  My complaint is with Amazon customer service -- all menu driven, didn't get to talk to a live person, the menu options weren't sufficient for what I wanted.  I would have been happy to just swap the defective Kindle for another one, but instead I got my money back.  No problem getting my money back.  But now I wonder why Amazon made it impossible for me to ""replace"" the Kindle.  Not happy with the customer service experience.

The reason I had to get a new tablet was because the tablet I bought in 2021 just died. There was no warning,no glitches,and no sign. I was not able to turn on the old one to transfer data. I have a lot of Audible books that I have purchased. Some are read and others not completed. I was not able to get them from the cloud. For whatever reason my e mail was not updated and is different from the present e mail I have on file.I have worked with several people. But have been unsuccessful in retrieving the data. I cannot remember the first account e mail address,as I thought it had been updated with my second Kindle.This has caused great frustration for me. I have taken the old kindle to a repair shop to see if they get it to turn back on. They too were unsuccessful. Now I have to about sending it a data retrieval company to see if they can help. Again this very frustrating. I was told but your staff that I would have repurchased the book I previously bought over the years and reestablish a new account to rebuild credits I had not yet used. This, I find to be an unsatisfactory solution. This latest kindle is my 4th.I would like a better solution/outcome.So far the new tablet is fine. but we will see how long it will last.

the Libby app would not load audio books to my old Fire anymore, so I purchased the latest and greatest one available.  The color is a lovely lavender.  Of course, once you have it in a folio case you really don't see much of it.  It is wonderful!  The volume control has more range than my last one and the larger screen is great for the fiber art patterns I read on it.  Easy to jump from the Libby app to the PDF of whatever pattern I am using that day.  I love listening to my audio books while make wonderful things in the evenings.  But I really don't want to get another one any time soon.  Hope to get a decade of use out of this one instead of just 5 that I got out of the last one before the security was so out of date I could not use it any longer.

If this one continues to work then I recommend the item and praise the Help CenterThis is my 5th Kindle, I have always had a great experience with them until now.  This Edition is full of performance defects.  Every 5 minutes it’s flips off of what you’re doing and asks what language you want to use.  Out of 5 minutes of use it spends 2 minutes on ads that you can’t click out of.  You can’t read 3 pages of a book before your redirect to add or language preference…. Kindle is sluggish and a hassle to use, have had it a week, emailed tech support and got no response.  Just found out I have to PAY $15 to stop the continuous ads 😡

I had bought one of these earlier in the year for myself. I really like it!It's very light weight and has a great screen quality. Touch screen, which is a must. Long battery life.I flew to Florida with it in my purse, (I used to take my laptop), this is so much better and easier to travel with. When I arrived in Florida and my sister saw it, she fell in love. So I ordered this one for her to take on her cruise. She didn't want to take her laptop (because of the weight and important documents she had on it). So this was perfect and arrived the same day! Just in time for her cruise. She was so excited and surprised  that I ordered it for her!! Happy sister and cruise!!

Ardsley Waxwing;My Dad Likes It A Lot;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;March 5, 2024;United States;"
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my elderly dad who's modestly familiar with modern day technology such as computers, and tablets (He doesn't own a smart phone). In the past my siblings and I have tried to give him tablets as a gift, or to borrow... and his enthusiasm was basically null; he barely touched his Android tablet. However, this Amazon Fire HD 10 was the first tablet he actually grew fond of the moment it turned on. Matter of fact he uses the Fire tablet daily in the reading room for web browsing, news apps, etc..., and he's quite content with its operation as demonstrated with his continued daily use of it.  The Fire tablet receives a minimum of one hour usage each day, and he only charges it on Sundays if that lends an idea to the Fire tablet's battery capability.In 2017 I bought a Fire HD 8 for my child, and it sustained in immense amount of abuse as would be expected from a 10 year old (drops, continual full discharges, power cable yanks, etc...), yet it still holds a charge, and works just fine today.  In no way will the Amazon AppStore rival Google Play apps, or Apple's App Store, however, if you want a very inexpensive tablet for web browsing, movies, TV shows, and games you can't go wrong with these very abled Amazon Fire tablets.I've heard you can actually fumble around and get some of Google's Play Store apps to successfully work on these Fire tablets because of the OS's similar Linux file structure... but let that be more of a welcoming surprise than an expectation. All in all it really is a decent inexpensive tablet.

I travel for business so this tablet is my primary way to stream video. The screen size is comfortable for viewing. I've been able to install all my paid streaming subscription Apps from Amazon's HORRIBLY limited App store and quite a few free ones. This tablet replaces my previous 10HD which developed problems with the micro USB charging port so it no longer charges. I was pleased to see this unit uses USB C, much easier to insert than micro USB.I DO recommend using aftermarket magnetic USB charging cables to avoid constant wear & tear on the charging port from frequent plugging/unplugging stress.Negatives? Limited selection of Apps available from Amazon App store. I was hoping to install some lite business Apps to avoid having to carry a laptop for travel but Amazon offers nothing adequate and non-Amazon Apps rarely function even if you manage to side load them. Love the bright Lilac color, makes it difficult to leave behind.

I have always had iPads and Apple products. As my more recent iPad is now broke, I really did not want to spend another $900 on another one. So, I was like, ""Let's try a kindle fire.""  For what I need, listening to music, listening to audiobooks. shopping online--it's perfect! No need to shell out $900 for an iPad. The only difference I really find is the speaker--it could be better quality, not terrible, but the location of it should be moved to hear it more clearly.

REVISION:  below is my original review. I did not do my research correctly and I was very unhappy. I have since purchased the option of getting rid of the ads and that has helped tremendously. At least now the Kindle is usable. Do not purchase without the option of having the ads removed. I'm just thankful I could do it after the fact.If I had known you could not download the Google Play Store on a kindle, I would have never bought this. It constantly is downloading games automatically and the ads are insane. If I hadn't been stupid and thrown away the original box when I got it, it would be going back.

SO— for reading and writing? This tablet is amazing! It’s very good for writing with the stylus it’s advertised with and does amazing when you want to read, whether that be on the internet or with the kindle app.But if you’re wanting to access sites like discord on the browser? Not so much. The Silk Browser isn’t great. (I downloaded Opera instead)It’s a bit slow, but for the price point it’s actually a really good tablet for an aspiring author like me!Combined with the draw function on One Note, it’s definitely worth it.

Nice tablet, but if you use Google Apps, beware.This is a nice tablet at a very good price and if you don't use Google Apps you will be happy with this tablet.However it does not come with the Google Play store installed. So if you use Google apps, like photos, chrome, YouTube TV, etc. you will have an issue. Most Google apps are not listed in the Amazon Appstore.I found an article on how to install the Google Play Store on a Fire tablet and followed the multi step instructions to get the Play Store installed. Once I did that, I could install the Google Apps I normally use and now I'm a happy camper.Note that to install the Play store is a best done by someone with experience downloading and installing ""APK"" files.To find the article on installing the Play Store search for:""install play store on fire tablet""

nice tablet. got a nice discount and trade-in. just be aware if you're trading in, the offer is a little misleading. it states that you receive 20% off a new tablet + $25 gift card. then it states the trade-in value (in my case) is $25. you would think you received 20% + $25 gift card + the trade-in value of $25. NO! the gift card is the trade in value. so, you receive 20% + $25 (IF, they evaluate your trade-in and find it to be acceptrable.) MISLEADING! and customer service was of no help. but, i am happy with the tablet, so far. will post any updates...

This is a replacement for my older table.  I love the clarity of the screen, how fast it boots up and how fast it accesses data.  I am learning how to use the stylus feature which is a great help for taking notes, creating sketches, making lists and just having fun.  Great product, with a lot of features for a very fair price.

I have had Kindles forever & love them. For the price they're great -- BUT think this latest Kindle is not their best (maybe they were in a rush to keep up with Apple). The first 2023 I rec'd was a mess out of the box & I returned. This second 2023 is better but still freezes up often & all you can do is walk away & it will eventually fix itself. But sometimes I will be in a certain app & the Kindle will suddenly go back to the home screen with everything that I was doing in the effected app lost. Also would love to see a Kindle app for Wells Fargo Bank -- why not?

Got this as a replacement after an accident shattered the screen on my previous gen tablet.  Display looks very nice, but the performance and speed seems slower than my previous Fire tablet.  Perhaps this is a software issue that will be taken care of in an upcoming update.

It still cuts off internet at times. It is a bright picture even with with blue light protection on.. It has a less sensitive touch screen with some stylus pens.If you download a lot, order a large SD card. It has more apps than the 11th generation. It also has extra mikes and cameras. Who knows what they can see and hear.Still love this tablet and Amazon because of great customer service and ease of ordering.

This is a great little tablet if you plan to use it primarily for Kindle reading and watching shows! This tablet lets you have Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, Paramount+, and more! My only complaint is that the Kindle app store is extremely limited with options and you can't put the Google app store on it. So if you want to use it as a full tablet, it falls short. There are a couple ways around a few things, like Walmart. You can use the Silk internet browser to go to the website and log in to your account. If Amazon would allow the Google app store, it would be a five star product.

This is my 7th Fire Tablet. Had to return original but this replacement came fast. However ….. this was delivered by the USPS. It was jammed into our mailbox. The outer box was destroyed but thankfully the inner packaging survived. It was dark out when we retrieved it but mail comes during daylight. Carrier could be more careful. I guess I’m just spoiled. My Amazon drivers are pleasant and deliver my packages like they would want their items delivered.

This is the 2023 ver. What a time I had with getting a Micro SD card that would work with the Internal storage. I bought 3 generic cards with 256g to 1T and none of them would work. Internal storage option was shaded out. Only good for portable storage. I finally bought the more expensive San-disc 256g that Amazon recommends and it works just fine. Go figure! There are Apps that I want to load. Ebay and Sandisk Connect to be 2 of them. Most tablets you go to the app store and those 2 are right there. Maybe I'm missing something. It should be easy and maybe it is for some but I'm having an issue here. For those reasons I'm not too happy with my purchase. I don't like having my tablet that I paid for being controlled by the company I bought it from.

Started years ago with a paper white Kindle. When it was reaching retirement time, move up to a Fire 8, which is essentially an Android tablet. My biggest complaint was brightness. It could not be used in bright daylight, in the shade, even at the brightest screen setting. Furthermore, when reading digital magazines, it was necessary to expand the view - with reading glasses! This Fire 10 is much brighter and now can read my books, on the patio,in the shade, and not needing to expand the view. Colors are more vibrant and battery life is longer. Bottom line, you are joined at the hip with Amazon and their preferred business partners.What I do not like about the Kindle Fire is the it limits the apps that can be installed. Fire tablets use a modified (by Amazon) Android operating system. Essentially, it is a Chrome Book tweaked to meet Amazon's business philosophy. The Fire is delivered with way too many unnecessary apps, especially games which are aimed towards young kids. Getting it out of your way isn't simple, either. Many apps can't be uninstalled.

Crystal clear screen, battery does not overheat like my previous one which is why I had to replace it however this one seems to be glitchy. It occasionally freezes and I have to wait for it to undo itself.

I purchased this tablet for monitoring security cameras, also purchased from Amazon.  So far, I’ve tested three different types of cameras, from two different manufacturers.  It’s critical that notifications are generated for security cameras, so this needs to be addressed.  One of the cameras, LaView, is not supported in the Amazon App Store so I had to load from the Google Play Store.  Amazon Tech Support was contacted regarding the lack of notifications and all they did was walk me thru a few setup screens and determined the issue was with the camera app, not the tablet.  Laview support has been great, they’ve reviewed the camera app logs and provided details showing the camera app did generate notifications as expected.  Notifications from these LaView cameras work fine on iPhone and iPad.The 2nd WiFi camera tested is from ReoLink, which is supported on the Amazon App Store.  I’m seeing the same issue with notifications, they work fine on the iPhone and iPad but not on the Fire Tablet.  I consider this issue as significant and should be addressed.

Really great for the price if you get it on sale. Then it's even better after adding play store + g services and nova launcher basically an android tablet. Even apps that say they won't work on the play store usually work in my experience. Screen isn't as bad as some of the reviews say. It's not the best but the viewing angles are actually pretty decent despite what some reviews said and it's pretty sharp. Sounds alright too not the loudest but enough. It's battery is a beast 48% after 11 days with 5 hours of screen time and tons of app installs. Cameras are pathetic they might as well have saved cost and not include them. It's also pretty light for the size. Plastic is great for functionality I'm tired of the style trend tech took.

Dave;Great Kindle;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: BlackStyle: Stylus Bundle;Verified Purchase;February 24, 2024;United States;"
This is primarily used to read ebooks.  Sound quality is excellent with wired earbuds.  A couple of issues.  Sometimes I play simple games on this device and I run into problems with screen sensitivity.  It is excellent but when I hold it in portrait mode and have to keep my hand close to the ""bottom"" of the screen otherwise it thinks I am inputting into the screen.  Used a stylist with it and it works great at translating my sloppy handwriting.  I have not come close to touching the full capabilities of using it as a writing tablet yet.As this is a higher resolution from the devices in the past the lock screen will now show video commercials instead of the image ones in the past.  Annoying but acceptable to me.

I love my new Fire HD 10!  I've had Kindles since they first came on the market and this is the best one yet!  Fills all my needs.  It was a Christmas present to myself and I use it every day.  I recommend it highly!

I just learned the joys of a Kindle again.  The new Fire HD 10 is like having a tablet and kindle together, which was the dream when I got my first Fire about 10 years ago!  I can actually watch streaming services (they have most) and also catch up on my reading.  So far nothing but good things to say about this.

I had purchased one and my wife loved it so I got her one.  Been about a year and I needed one for my church job so I bought a 3rd one.  Best tablet!!! I've had cheap ones and ones by Samsung and these beat them all!

Michael S.;It serves my purposes but Android It's not;Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GBOffer Type: With Lockscreen AdsColor: OceanStyle: Amazon Fire HD 10;Verified Purchase;November 4, 2023;United States;"
I like it but I'm not impressed. The tablet is exactly how it is described. Fast and with a quality display. I primarily use a tablet for viewing movies, downloaded videos and maybe a little Internet. Nothing that includes the word ""work"" associated with it. I traded in an old 7 inch Android tablet that I was using for the same purposes. These eyes are older, I need bigger and this met my price point on sale. That being said it's time to provide some information on the huge differences between Amazon Fire and Android tablets. Apps are how we live on them and you may be disappointed in the app availability for the Fire. Not just availability, but lack of newer, updated versions. Some of the available apps are rimming 2 or 3 years since their last update. If you want to visit the web you're pretty much stuck with the Silk browser that comes with it. It's a good browser and secure mostly but if you have some 3rd party apps designed to be available on other platforms such as a calendar or password keeper, don't count on any extensions or syncs being compatible. The Fire Tablet is pretty much self contained, it's not interested in the rest of the world and while it operates under the Android 11 umbrella it uses its own set of rules. Cross platform use does work with OneCloud and Google Drive. It's getting the apps for that to work on the Fire that's the issue. An example is a password keeper that is downloadable from the Amazon App Store and will install and operate on the tablet just fine. But the browser extension used to grab passwords from its cloud to fill in automatically on logins won't install on the Silk browser. I am tech savvy to a point and I like to test the limitations on devices. The Fire maxes out fairly quickly. So, going back to what I was saying before, I use it for viewing videos, mostly while flying, and this has a great display to do that.

Edit-im returning 12 hrs later, same issues happening again.  I'm VERY DISAPPOINTEDEdit - Customer service responded quickly to my review.  They were very helpful.  Updating didn't work, but once I reset back to factory, and started over, it seems that everything is working ok.  I am feeling like the issue was from the Ads that came with the tablet.  It is work the few extra dollars to get it without ads that is for sure.This is my 3rd Fire tablet, so I am happy the issues have been resolved.Anyone having issues with the keyboard popping up every 2-5 seconds on this tablet?  I have seen where they are having issues with this, and not a fix yet from December.If there is a fix, I would like to know before I wipe and send it back.  This is very annoying as you cannot do ANYTHING on this with the screen popping every few seconds.

This is my 4 tablet I have owned from Amazon.  On I traded in  as it was time to retire it. And then my Fire 8 died.  So it was time for a new tablet. So I picked the this new version.  I want to sleep listening to a book and it was awful.  The sound from my other tablet 2022 sounds so much better.  For some reason this new version of has a tinny sound.  The BT speaker is better.  But I am disappointed in the sound quality.

I have been buying fire tablets since they came out. This one is small enough to travel with but large enough to see things fully and clearly. This one was a gift for my grandson and he tells me frequently that he loves it. It has more storage space than his previous one.

I stepped up from a Fire HD7 a few months ago and liked to 10 so much more. The speaker is better, the response time is excellent and the extra screen real estate is a treat for middle-age eyes. I use my Fire 10 to watch movies and videos while working on my laptop. I also downloaded a number of news and weather apps, perfect for when you're traveling.
