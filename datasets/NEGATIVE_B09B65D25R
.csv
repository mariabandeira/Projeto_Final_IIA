The price isn't bad, and people love it when I wear them, but the nose piece fell off after one use and I have an issue with reflections from what is behind me when I am looking through the glasses.

James McElfresh;Returned.  All 3 pairs arrived scratched up.;0;Verified Purchase;March 12, 2024;United States;"
The lenses are scratched on all 3 pairs of glasses. I could not tell if these were used, or just poorly packaged.Each pair of glasses arrived in an individual plastic ziplock bag, and the 3 pairs together were inside a larger plastic ziplock bag.Even though these are a cheap novelty item I expect to receive a new product in new condition, not scratched up junk.
